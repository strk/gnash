** Server:

   Linking Gnash statically or dynamically with other modules is making
   a combined work based on Gnash. Thus, the terms and conditions of
   the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
   
   In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Gnash give
   you permission to combine Gnash with free software programs or
   libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and/or with Mozilla, 
   so long as the linking with Mozilla, or any variant of Mozilla, is
   through its standard plug-in interface. You may copy and distribute
   such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for Gnash and the
   licenses of the other code concerned, provided that you include the
   source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires
   distribution of source code. 
   
   Note that people who make modified versions of Gnash are not obligated
   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
   permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
   exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
   carries forward this exception.

	  for use by javascript-based flash version detection kits.

2007-08-13  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: State that a <= 2.4 version of AGG is an error.

2007-08-16 Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

	* libbase/network.cpp (Network::createServer): fix a bug making
	  the test for DEFAULTPROTO == "udp" always fail.

2007-08-15 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	  depth at end of execution to take depth at *start* of execution
	  into account.

2007-08-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp (cleanupAfterRun): don't assume the call

	  bug #20740.

2007-08-10 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* server/dlist.cpp: revert mask related code, fix bug#20655, which is
	  a blocker.
	
2007-08-10 Alexander Sack <asac@jwsdot.com>

	  server/Makefile.am: use $pkglibdir for unversioned libs.

2007-08-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (sound_stream_block_loader): don't
	  discard the first 4 bytes if not reading an MP3. Makes ADPCM
	  sound better for the feed.swf case (but ADPCM decoder needs
	  lot more work to be correct)

2007-08-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp (getGlyph): don't abort if
	  FT_Load_Char doesn't return an outline glyph, rather print
	  an UNIMPLEMENTED message and the type of glyph you got.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (ADPCMDecoder::adpcm_expand):
	  Rather then throwing a ParseException, just print an error
	  as it's much likely the error is in Gnash parser, rather
	  then in a malformed SWF, and tests show we do a better
	  job like that then by stopping the parser.
	  Also, print an error if the bytesNeeded computation doesn't
	  match the actual number of bytes read.

2007-08-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: move all ADPCM-related code in an
	  ADPCMDecoder class.

	  make UFO flash version detector happy. Fixes bug #20696.

2007-08-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: drop set_variable() methods.
	  Have setVariables() call set_member directly (might change in the
	  future to call as_environment's set_variable, if we find out
	  variables in query string, FlashParams and loadVariable loaded text
	  files can contain path elements).

2007-08-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/LoadVars.as: enabled tests erroneously
	  committed disabled.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (processCompletedLoadVariableRequests):
	  use set_member, not set_variable - the latter is only meant to be
	  called on the root movie.
	* server/impl.cpp, server/swf/tag_loaders.{cpp,h}: stub parsing
	  of REFLEX tag.
	* server/asobj/Mouse.cpp: make the global Mouse symbol point
	  to an object, not a constructor.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Mouse.as: xcheck -> check.

2007-08-08 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler_{sdl,gst}.cpp: Detect and fix if a soundstream

	  fixes bug #20681.

2007-08-08 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Fix counting of samples played,
	  and use the output samplerate to calculate the playhead position
	  in time, fixes/improves bug #20684.

2007-08-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Makefile.am: clean the 'gnash' script on make clean.

	  integrity checks. Add a GNASH_TRUST_SWF macro to turn ensureBytes
	  to a no-op.
	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp (read_fill_styles,
	  read_line_styles, read): don't read past end of tag. Don't try to
	  recover if an exception is thrown by fill style parser.
	* server/styles.{cpp,h} (line_style::read): don't read past end of tag.
	* server/fill_style.{cpp,h} (read): don't read past end of tag.
	* server/types.{cpp,h} (rgba::read_rgba, rgbe::read): don't read past end
	  of tag.
	* server/parser/action_buffer.cpp (read): don't read past end of tag.
	* Makefile.am: don't list 'doc' twice in subdirs. Fixes 'distclean'
	  rule.

2007-08-07 Sergio Costas <raster (at) rastersoft.com>

	* backend/sound_handler_gst.cpp: Fix returns from getPosition
	  (patch #6140), and fix a segfault when asking for position
	  before sound has been started (patch #6138).
	* backend/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Fix returns from getPosition
	  (patch #6140).

2007-08-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	  of the manual.
	* doc/C/Makefile.am, doc/C/asspec/Makefile.am: don't list entities

	  of the tests, disable a test depending on timezone. Please
	  further tests on Date go to the Date.as file.
	* server/as_value.{cpp,h}: add a to_int() method taking
	  care of compatible integer conversion. Add note about
	  deprecation of templated to_number<>.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: explicitly use to_int() in bitwise
	  ops. Fixes ops.as testcases built with newer Ming. Add TODO
	  lines about possible other uses.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: bitwise-{5,6,7}.swf now pass.

2007-08-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: add test for 0xffffffff
	  conversion to integer needing to be -1 (gnash fails, need Ming head
	  to reproduce)
	* server/video_stream_instance.cpp (markReachableResources): don't
	  forget to call the character's version of resource marking !!
	  Fixes bug #20657.

2007-08-06 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: xcheck to check, it passed here.
	  
2007-08-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/character_def.h: provide a protected copy constructor
	  resetting the render_cache_manager to NULL in the copy, to avoid
	  multiple destruction of the same object. Add private and aborting
	  assignment operator. Fixes bug #20694.
	* server/parser/shape_character_def.{cpp,h}: implement copy
	  constructor. Add private and aborting assignment operator.
	  Deprecate input/output cache methods and data.

	  data for input/output stuff.

2007-08-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/VM.h: make gnash buildable with GC unused.

2007-08-05 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as, Makefile.am: focused tests, 
	  hopefully helps the model("String" object is not bogus, and "trace" is also sane).
	
2007-08-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: fixed testcase.

2007-08-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/generic-testrunner.sh: it seems 'read' w/out arg
	  starts being a problem with some shells.

2007-08-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gnash.in: add missing she bang.

2007-08-04 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* server/array.cpp:
	  Pointers to the as_environment object in the as_value comparison
	  functors are now references.
	  Fix a bug caused by a missing return statement in the get_basic_eq
	  function.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as:
	  UNIQUE -> UNIQUESORT flag.
	  add some tests to see how AS objects implementing the valueOf method
	  interact with array class methods.

2007-08-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/xmlnode.{cpp,h}: mark reachable resources
	  (childs and parent).

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Stage.cpp (notifyResize): use PROPNAME()
	  for proper case of notification event. Finish the dangling
	  referneces drop thing.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Stage.{cpp,h}: Mark all listeners as reachable,
	  drop the unused dropDanglingListeners (since it's verified
	  the Stage doesn't store *weak* pointers).

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp (getStage): properly convert case when
	  fetching the "Stage" object from SWF6 or lower.
	* server/asobj/Stage.cpp (onResize): properly convert case
	  when fetching the "scaleMode" property from SWF6 or lower.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Stage.as: test deleting an object
	  which is also a listener (Gnash segfaults).

2007-08-03 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* server/array.{cpp,h}: fixes previously identified issues with
	  array.cpp involving functions that needed to be environment and
	  SWF-version aware (mainly functions involved in sorting). 
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: xcheck->check, few more
	  tests.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/NetStream.{cpp,h}: mark associated as_environment
	  as reachable (but I think there are ownership problem there,
	  the as_environment might be deleted before the NetStream object
	  is, in which case we'd access random memory).

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: make sure PKG_CONFIG is defined before calling 
	  GNAH_PATH_XXX. Made the notice clearer about GNASH_PATH_XX
	  need to be put after it.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: move GTK detection code *after* the cross-compiling
	  section, so that $incllist is properly set. Add notice about
	  the fact that any GNASH_PATH_XX must be invoked after that one.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* Makefile.am: only descend in doc/ subdir if DOCBOOK is enabled.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: check GTK dependencies only if $build_gtk=yes.
	  print a WARNING and set $build_gtk=no if deps are not met.
	  All of this is done *before* NSAPI is checked, so it would
	  correctly be built or not depending on $build_gtk only.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: fix automatic kparts/nsapi plugin build
	  based on gui availability.

2007-08-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: fix misleading warning about KDE/GTK gui 
	  not being built while KPARTS/NSAPI plugin is when instead
	  the guis are actually being built.

2007-08-03 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* server/array.cpp: fix iterators invalidation (bug #20667).

2007-08-03  Rob Savoye  <rob@deal.welcomehome.org>

	* configure.ac: Fix typo so --disable-nsapi works. Cleanup the
	logic of what gets built when. Add a few warnings.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* Makefile.am: add plugins info to 'dumpconfig' output,
	  simplify the SUBDIR construction (side-effect is we always
	  descend to most subdirs, even if there's nothing to do in them)
	* plugin/Makefile.am: don't build libgnashplugin if NSAPI
	  conditional is false; always descend to klash/ subdir
	  and let the inner Makefile.am handle conditionals for KPARTS.
	* plugin/klash/Makefile.am: don't override the 'all' target.

2007-08-02  Rob Savoye  <rob@deal.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/Makefile.am: Use BUILD_KDE_GUI instead of KLASH. Use
	NSAPI instead of PLUGIN, KPARTS instead of KLASH.
	* Makefile.am: Change from PLUGIN to NSAPI and KPARTS for conditionals. 
	* configure.ac: Change --disable-klash to --disable-kparts, add
	--disable-nsapi to replace the older --disable-plugin
	setting. Make building the plugins conditional on the gui being
	selected and if the development libraries exist.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Comment out the dyna,ic vs static support, it's
	uneeded for now.
	* macros/firefox.m4: Use nsapi instead of plugin as the
	conditional.
	* macros/kde.m4: set has_kde to yes by default. It can get
	disabled later.
	* plugin/klash/Makefile.am: Use KPARTS instead of KLASH.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/gen-asclass.sh: add the addStatic call to statics.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: use a member (and a getter) for the global
	  key object, and properly mark it as alive.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: register statics.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: register statics.
	* server/video_stream_instance.cpp: register statics.
	* server/array.cpp: register static constructor and prototype,
	  since arrays are used by the core independentely of their
	  availability as global classes (function arguments are arrays).
	* server/as_function.cpp: register static constructor and prototype,
	  since functions are used by the core independently of their
	  availability as global classes (each function uses the Function
	  prototype).

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: more tests for 'string' == NaN.
	* server/as_value.cpp (equals): yet another pass at
	  abstract equality operator. We're still not there, but
	  getting closer.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: xcheck -> check.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: Function.as, ops.as:
	  Moved tests for equality operator against MovieClip where
	  it belongs.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: test MovieClip.valueOf().
	* server/as_value.{cpp,h}: as_environment parameter made mandatory
	  for the equals() method.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionEquals): update calls to
	  as_value::equals().

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: add test for Array.valueOf().
	* server/as_value.cpp (equals) : fix true==1 and true!=2
	  (was failing).
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: shift right/left : take undefined
	  values as zeroes.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: minor additions, xcheck to
	  check.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/PropertyList.cpp: add compile-time macro for debugging
	  property allocations.

2007-08-02 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.cpp: Warn when compiling for OLPC, change compile-time
	  error to runtime error to be multi-GUI friendly.

2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/NetConnection.h: remove the unused _owner method.

2007-08-02 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: more tests, checks to xchecks.
	  
2007-08-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Makefile.am: comment out the _DEPENDENCIES lines. Properly
	  rebuilds the binaries when needed (might be breaking another kind
	  of dependency, but this one was pretty disturbing for me in that
	  it didn't trigger rebuil when _LIBS changed)
	* server/asobj/MovieClipLoader.cpp: implement reachable resources
	  marker (listeners).
	* server/movie_root.cpp: set background to white by default.
	  Should fix bug #20655.

2007-08-02 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: more tests and more failures. still
	  need more, we don't want fail on those basic logical operations.
	  
2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (define_sound_loader): fix a bug
	  introduced by last commit (sorry)

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: completely remove the bogus assertion
	  about the required input bytes in relation to the number of samples.
	  Rather, add more ensureBytes() uses, closer to where the data is
	  actually read from the stream.

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (sound_expand): fix assertion
	  checking; added some uses of the new stream::ensureBytes() method;
	  add more scoped_array uses.

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/stream.h: add ensureBytes() method to verify
	  SWF integrity.

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: (define_sound_loader) check if number of
	  samples exceed available bytes in the tag. (sound_expand) assertion
	  checking. (u8_expand) use a scoped_array in the easy case (we'll
	  need more smart pointers in general).
	* backend/sound_handler.h (create_sound, fill_stream_data): document ownership
	  of the 'data' argument, and add a TODO item about changing
	  the interface.

2007-08-01 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.cpp: Support the OLPC again

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/: Boolean.cpp, Number.cpp, string.cpp:
	  register static constructors and prototypes with the VM.
	* server/vm/VM.{cpp,h}: Add support for registering
	  arbitrary as_object for reachability. Intended to
	  be used whenever a static as_object pointer is allocated.

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gnash.in: don't loose parameters layout. Fixes bug #20651.
	* gui/Makefile.am: distribute gnash.in

2007-08-01 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.{cpp,h}: stubbed pixel format detection. Will
	  break OLPC support but fix bug #20649 for all others.

2007-08-01 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler_gst.{h,cpp}: Switch to try_mutex, and in 
	  callback_handoff only try to lock, and return if unsuccesfull
	  to avoid a potential deadlock, fixes bug #20596. Warning fixes.

2007-08-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* plugin/plugin.cpp: run 'gtk-gnash' by default.

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac, gui/Makefile.am: comment out --enable-dynamic-gui
	  and related conditionals use.

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: more tests for Array.sort()
	  and Array.sortOn(). These tests are mainly to explore the behavior
	  of sorting arrays of objects that override the toString() method and
	  sortOn using properties specified by such objects. 
	  Tests provided by Ivor Blockley and cleaned up/fixed by me.

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* plugin/klash/klash_part.cpp: run 'kde-gnash' by default
	  (not 'klash')
	* gui/gnash.in: don't pass -G over to the actual executable;
	  translate gui name to lowercase.

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/: Makefile.am, gnash.in:
	  Initial draft of a 'gnash' wrapper.

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: rename GUI_CONFIG to SUPPORTED_GUIS to
	  avoid confusion with the define later set by gui/Makefile.am
	* gui/Makefile.am: build an executable for each supported
	  GUI, named <gui>-gnash
	* gui/Player.{cpp,h}: drop runtime parsing of gui name, just
	  use whatever gui is specified by the GUI_CONFIG macro set
	  by the Makefile.
	* gui/gnash.cpp: drop runtime GUI selection  (and -G switch).

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ming_utils.c: add word wrapping
	  to the xtrace window.

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* doc/C/usermanual/installation/feature_configuration.xml:
	  Document --enable-mit-shm
	* configure.ac: add --enable-mit-shm
	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.h: don't redefine ENABLE_MIT_SHM, use definition
	  from config.h

2007-07-31 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.h: disable MIT-SHM by default (see bug #20301)

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionBitwiseAnd):
	  take nan operands as zero.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: Makefile.am, ops.as:
	  new testcase for primitive operations (to complete)

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionBitwiseXor, ActionBitwiseOr): 
	  take nan operands as zero.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: expect less failures.

2007-07-31 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/place_object_test2.c, Makefile.am
	  activate the testcase, fix setting the ratio value(0~1.0 in Ming).
	  
2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: expect a failure
	  in the case-insensitive descending sort tested for SWF>6

2007-07-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/array.cpp (join): use the SWF-version aware version
	  of as_value to string conversion. Add TODO items.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: don't expect a failure
	  in the descending numeric sort

2007-07-31 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/duplicate_movie_clip_test.c, place_object_test.c,
	  place_object_test2.c: trivial comments cleanups.
	  
2007-07-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libamf/Makefile.am: add BOOST libs
	* testsuite/samples/Makefile.am: link in
	  libgnashserver.la, libgnashbase.la and
	  libgnashamf.la.

2007-07-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/render_handler_tri.cpp: implemented world_to_pixel and
	  pixel_to_world (to check, UdoG, can you ?)
	* gui/gtksup.h: remove any use of RENDERER_XXY defines, use 
	  the GtkGlue interface only (keep by auto_ptr)
	* gui/gtk_glue.h: header guard (no code was including this :/)
	* gui/gtk.cpp: updated use of the glue, remove as much as possible
	  uses of RENDERER_XXY, the only left are for glue initialization
	  (headers and constructions) and for the call to prepDrawingArea
	  which needs to be ordered differently for OGL and for other
	  renderers.

2007-07-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: Change --enable-renderer to accept a *single* renderer
	  as the gui code / build scripts are not ready to handle multiple ones
	  currently (temp hack for 0.8.1). By default, renderer is AGG now.

2007-07-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/SoundGst.cpp (getPosition): fix typo (len=>pos).
	* server/parser/edit_text_character_def.h: use device fonts
	  by default (matches the comment near it, was just a typo).
	  Fixes dynamic textfields using device fonts.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: expect one failure
	  less.

2007-07-30 Sergio Costas <raster (at) rastersoft.com>

	* backend/sound_handler_gst.cpp: Use the audioconverter element
	  to get the current position, to avoid delay.
	* server/asobj/SoundGst.cpp: Fixed some faulty conversions to
	  milliseconds.

2007-07-30 Alexander Sack <asac@jwsdot.com>

	* server/asobj/NetStreamGst.cpp: Fix plugin loading
	  for non-modern Gstreamer versions.

2007-07-30 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* gui/Info.plist.in: Tidy up the version info, fixed icon.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Build OS X bundle if GUI == AQUA.
	* gui/aqua.cpp: Implemented OS-version checking and setCursor.
	  Added 'About' and 'Preferences...' menus.

2007-07-29  Rob Savoye  <rob@deal.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/firefox.m4: Always install the plugin in ~/.mozilla/plugins.

2007-07-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: drop add_gui variable again, use another way to
	  handle a missing --enable-gui.

2007-07-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: don't force KDE gui everytime plugin is disabled (sic).

2007-07-29 Nick Warne <nick@ukfsn.org>

	* configure.ac: don't rely on has_kde *before* it is attempted to be
	  set.

2007-07-29 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* server/array.{cpp,h}: implement remaining array.sort(..) functionality
	  (flags UNIQUE and RETURNINDEXEDARRAY) all of array.sortOn(...)
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: test for Array.sort and
	  Array.sortOn

2007-07-29 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* server/array.cpp: Fix bug in the array.splice(index) method to
	  prevent an incorrect number of elements being spliced; fix bug
	  in the array.slice(startindex, endindex) method for certain
	  negative endindexes; elements in a newly created array with
	  non-zero size are now assigned a value of 'undefined' rather
	  than 'null'; trivial optimizations/clean-ups.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: more tests.

2007-07-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@deal.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/ffmpeg.m4: Add test for libswscale, which is needed if
	ffmpeg is configured with --enable-gpl --enable-swscale. bug #20002.

2007-07-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: re-introduce the $add_gui variable, so that a vanilla
	  configuration still tries to build gtk and kde guis; don't make fb
	  renderer and cairo gui incompatible (other guis might be requested,
	  we'd need a better test to check that at least one compatible with
	  cairo is there)

2007-07-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: don't miss to set add_renderer when no
	  --enable-renderer is given, and only abort complaining if NO
	  GUI supporting opengl is built while also requesting to build opengl
	  renderer.

2007-07-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: proper quote args given to test (in the code
	  snippet handling --enable-gui)

2007-07-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* po/Makefile.am: use GMSGFMT, rather then verbatim 'msgfmt'.
	* configure.ac: simplify gui selection code, fix bug listing
	  same gui twice.
	* gui/gui_fb.cpp: typo fix (FbGui => FBGui).
	* testsuite/misc-mtasc.all/Makefile.am: distribute
	  mtasc related files even if mtasc is not detected.

2007-07-28 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>
	
	* configure.ac: Don't try building KDE/Klash if we'vent got the libs...
	* gui/aqua*, gui/Info.pist, gui/images/GnashG.icns, gui/Makefile.am: 
	  Now we can build a bundle by running 'make bundle', albeit I must
	  fix the linkage.

2007-07-27 Nick Warne <nick@ukfsn.org>

	* plugin/klash/klash_part.cpp: typo (0l => 0L)

2007-07-27 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler.h, backend/sound_handler_gst.{cpp,h},
	backend/sound_handler_sdl.{cpp,h}, server/asobj/SoundFfmpeg.{h,cpp},
	server/asobj/SoundGst.{h,cpp}, server/asobj/SoundMad.{h,cpp}:
	Implement duration and position properties when using Sound objects
	to control an eventsound, patch partly by Sergio Costas.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: Fix warnings.

2007-07-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Makefile.am: distribute kde_glue_opengl.h.

2007-07-27 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* gui/DESIGN: Added some docmentation on the GUI-API.
	* gui/Player.cpp: define DEAFULT_GUI as a string instead of enum.

2007-07-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: Don't threat static linking specially, multiple
	  GUIs can still be supported by that.

2007-07-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: don't assume that if GTK gui is used only the
	  GTK-pixelformat is needed (other GUIs might be built).
	  Fixes bug #20586.
	* gui/Player.{cpp,h}: Be more verbose on gui initialization error.
	* gui/kde.cpp (createWindow): return false if renderer creation
	  failed.
	* gui/kde_glue_agg.cpp (createRenderHandler): throw an exception if
	  render handler could not be created.
	
2007-07-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gnash.cpp: scan argv[0] and select KDE gui if it contains
	  the string 'klash'.
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, gui/Makefile.am:
	  Don't miss to list 'kde' as a gui when built as a side-effect
	  of enabling klash: fixes proper report of which GUI have been
	  compiled-in; Take first gui given to --enable-gui as the default
	  one.
	* gui/Player.cpp: don't force a default gui, take the one defined
	  by build line (or default to nullGui).
	* gui/gnash.cpp: print default gui from --version.

2007-07-26 Alexander Sack <asac@jwsdot.com>

	* server/asobj/NetStreamGst.cpp: Don't use a variable before it 
	  has been initialized.

2007-07-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Makefile.am: build libgnashplayer again,
	  linked against libgnashgui, which is linked
	  against any gui/renderer specific lib that was
	  built
	* gui/Player.{cpp,h}: use named constructors to create
	  guis, so to avoid the need of including GUI-specific
	  headers (which do conflict).
	* gui/gui.h: make constructors protected, provide named
	  (free functions) constructors for the different guis.
	* gui/: gui_aqua.cpp, gui_fb.cpp, gui_fltk.cpp, gui_gtk.cpp,
	  gui_kde.cpp, gui_riscos.cpp, gui_sdl.cpp: modules implementing
	  the GUI named constructors.

2007-07-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Player.{cpp,h}: add support for multiple GUI libs.
	  They can be statically or dynamically linked (not loaded as plugins
	  yet).
	* gui/gnash.cpp: add a -G switch to select GUI. If the gui wasn't
	  compiled in an exception will be thrown (and dunno why not propery
	  cought..).

2007-07-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: set the BUILD_<gui> conditionals *after* giving kde
	  gui a chance to be picked back as a dependency of 'klash'.
	  This fixes a buil bug when klash is enabled by only gtk gui is
	  selected.
	* lots of files : fixed Copyright info (delete spurious empty line,
	  add year 2007).

2007-07-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.h: remove unneeded "container.h" include.
	* server/as_value.cpp (equalsSameType): fixed nan comparison.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Number.as: fixed NaN != NaN test
	  (should return false). Add NaN == NaN test (should return true);
	  Add (0/2) == (0/5) (shoudl return true).

2007-07-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.cpp: drop lowercase_if_needed, substitute with
	  the PROPNAME macro.
	* server/as_value.h: add a PROPNAME macro to perform the lowercase
	  conversion of property names when needed (copies arg)
	* server/as_environment.h: added some notes about variable name
	  case conversion.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: removed unused lowercase_if_needed
	  function.
	* gui/Makefile.am: build klash when conditinally enabled
	* gui/gnash.cpp: add missing newline after Gstreamer version
	  (--version).

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: minor test for
	  proper properties 'loadMovie' and 'loadMovieNum'.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: make the
	  PP_COMPATIBLE_DEVICE_FONT_HANDLING back to undefined
	  by default. It's incomplete and premature to attempt
	  limitation-level compatibility.
	* configure.ac: don't take absence of libAGG as if an
	  old version was found. Fixes bug #20011.

2007-07-24 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* server/parser/video_stream_def.cpp: Free the video frames
	  when deleting the video_stream_def object. Make the buffer
	  containing the video data 4 bytes bigger than needed to avoid
	  illegal reads from ffmpeg. Fixes bug #20440.

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* Makefile.am: define PHONY rules.

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: add a
	  PP_COMPATIBLE_DEVICE_FONT_HANDLING macro to mimic
	  limitation of proprietary player in handling textfields
	  using device fonts. See DeviceFonts wiki page for more
	  information. (The macro defaults to being defined)

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/SoundFfmpeg.h: Provide a constructor
	  for proper initialization of members.
	  YOU CAN NOT ASSUME POINTERS WILL BE INITIALIZED TO NULL.
	  Fixes bug #20578.

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/text.cpp (display_glyph_records): don't render invalid glyphs
	  as empty boxes, unless a DRAW_INVALID_GLYPHS_AS_EMPTY_BOXES macro
	  is defined.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (setEmbedFonts):
	  Set _embedFonts *before* calling format_text, or
	  glyph indexes will be messed up.

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/font.{cpp,h}: Refactor class definition
	  to maintain two separate glyph information sets:
	  one for device and one for embedded glyphs. Added
	  a parameter to glyph-related accessors and mutators
	  to specify which set to use.
	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}: update gnash::font
	  services call to select embedded or device fonts.
	* server/fontlib.cpp: updated calls to gnash::font so
	  to always use embedded ones (mostly caching stuff, which
	  is currently disabled)
	* server/text.{cpp,h}: add a boolean parameter to
	  display_glyph_records to specify wheter to use embedded
	  or device glyphs when fetching them from the font.
	* server/parser/text_character_def.cpp: use embedded glyphs.

2007-07-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/edit_text_character_def.h:
	  initialize m_use_outlines to true (so dynamically-created
	  textfields will use device fonts by default), provide
	  a getUseEmbeddedGlyphs() public method.
	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}: add an _embedFonts member
	  initialized using edit_text_character_def::getUseEmbeddedGlyphs(),

	* server/gnash.h: fix PGDN and PGUP key constants
	* server/asobj/Global.cpp: initialize the "Key" class
	  even in SWF5.
	* server/asobj/Key.cpp: use init_member rather then set_member
	  when initializing constants, reduce complexity of compile-time
	  switches for NEW_KEY_LISTENER_LIST_DESIGN, general cleanups.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: Makefile.am, Key.as: new testcase
	  for Key object

2007-07-24 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* plugin/klash/Makefile.am: define GNASHBINDIR.
        * configure.ac: don't define RENDERER_AGG *before* the build_agg

2007-07-23 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: Fix help strings: --with-{gui,renderer} => --enable-{gui,renderer}
	* plugin/klash/klash_part.cpp: invoke "klash", not "gnash".
	  Allow KLASH_PLAYER environment variable to change what's
	  invoked. The plan is that "klash" would be an alias for
	  "gnash --gui=kde".

2007-07-23 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: make get_world_cxform() again

	  headers from SWF *generators* !
	* configure.ac: provide a RENDERER_LIBS listing all built renderer
	  libraries
	* testsuite/Makefile.am: link libgnashtestsuite against all built 
	  renderer libraries.

2007-07-20 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: rename the gui/renderer selection switch
	  back to --enable-{gui,renderer} so we don't need to update
	  our existing configuration wrapper scripts; dynamic loading
	  of gui/renderer is disabled by default, so advertise the switch
	  to enable.

2007-07-20 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/unload_movieclip_test1.c: comments
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextTest.c: removed some incorrect

	* backend/render_handler_agg_style.h: fixed initialization order
	  warnings.
	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: signedness and initialization list

	  passed.
	
2007-07-17 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	  (scale and offset don't work consistently yet).

2007-07-10 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/movie_root.cpp: remove the key listener from the listener container, 
	  not just unregister it.
	* server/movie_root.h: add a public getKeyListeners() to return the key listener set.

2007-07-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am: add rules for building
	  key_event_test4.swf and key_event_test5.swf - test *runners* still
	  missing.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: mark key listeners as reachable.
	* server/asobj/Key.{cpp,h}: mark key listeners as reachable.

2007-07-10 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/key_event_test5.c: new testcase for key listeners,

2007-07-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/video_stream_def.{h,cpp}: drop the m_width and m_height
	  public members, substitute them with a private m_bound (renamed
	  from m_unused_bound since it is now used). This fixes get_bound
	  to return a meaningful value.
	* server/video_stream_instance.{cpp,h}: stop using m_width and m_height
	  of the definition, rather use the get_bound() method.
	  Fixes bug #20177 (Youtube: half the video hidden)

2007-07-09 Martin Guy <martinwguy@yahoo.it>

	* gui/gtk_cairo.h: FIx compiler warning about unused params
	* libbase/curl_adapter.cpp: Workarounds for older versions of curl

2007-07-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.{cpp,h} (equals): don't always force string
	  comparison if the first argument is a string (matches ECMA spec,
	  fixes bug #20403).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Number.as: add test for string:00 ==
	  number:0

2007-07-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* doc/C/usermanual/installation/feature_configuration.xml:
	  the debugger is now off by default, so document --enable-debugger
	  rather then --disable-debugger; Document --enable-write and
	  --enable-fps-debug.

2007-07-08 Martin Guy <martinwguy@yahoo.it>

	* configure.ac: Say where to get gtkglext source
	* C/usermanual/installation/feature_configuration.xml:

	  and remove configure --enable-dom (it has gone)
	  Remove doc for configure --enable-xmlreader and --enable-testing
	  (they have gone too)
	  Remove mention of old --enable-sound, fix default as --enable-plugin
	  and talk about MAD / GST-FFMPEG differences.
	* gui/gtk_glue_cairo.h: Drop unused variable compiler warnings
	* backend/sound_handler.h libbase/FLVParser.h:
	  Document extra NELLYMOSER format code (mentioned in libavcodec/flv.h)
	* macros/ffmpeg.m4: Don't zero ffmpeg_version if too early; it is used
	  in the final error report and is always checked against "ok" to see
	  if there is an acceptable version.
	* macros/ffmpeg.m4: Add commentary preparing for better version checking

2007-07-07 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

2007-07-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/ref_counted.h: use boost's atomic_count
	  for the reference counter. Should be safer.
	  Fixed bug #20194.

2007-07-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (CommonGetUrl): use
	  sprite_instance::loadMovie for target loads.
	  Fixes bug #20001
	* server/vm/action.{cpp,h}: obsolete attach_extern_movie
	  in favor of sprite_instance::loadMovie, known to work
	  better in at least one case (bug #20001).

2007-07-06 Martin Guy <martinwguy@yahoo.it>

	* backend/Makefile.am: Move a GUI test to its logical place
	* testsuite/libamf.all/test_number.cpp: Remove uused variables and
	  commented-out debugging printfs
	* gui/gnash.cpp: Reformat crazy indentation and simplify redundant

2007-07-05 Martin Guy <martinwguy@yahoo.it>

	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.cpp: Report internal sample ID too in
	  verbose parse log message

2007-07-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/sprite_definition.h (add_sound_sample): don't

	* configure.ac: disable debugger by default. Use --enable-debugger
	  to enable.

2007-07-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Global.{cpp,h}: Don't use a module-static
	  for the Extension instance, when enabled.
	  Seems to fix bug #20272 when debugger id disabled
	  (sounds voodoo, but these are the effects of initialization
	  and deinitialization order for statics...)

2007-07-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gnash.cpp (parseCommandLine): -g doesn't take an argument.
	* libbase/GC.{cpp,h}: define 3 verbosity levels for the GC

2007-07-03 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/NullGui.cpp: implement correct timing

2007-07-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/render_handler_tri.{cpp,h}: (tri_cache_manager): dont leak
	  mesh sets.
	* server/parser/character_def.{cpp,h}: don't leak
	  render cache managers.

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler_sdl.{cpp,h}: fix leak of sound_data instances;
	  added a few TODO items.

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/edit_text_character_def.h: add an htmlAllowed()
	  public inspector.
	* server/edit_text_character.h: add an htmlAllowed() private
	  inspector.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (format_text): if HTML is allowed
	  and found in the textfield text, just skip the tags and show the 
	  content, logging a debugging info about the fact (only once).

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp: protect debugging calls
	  by a GNASH_DEBUG_DEVICEFONTS, defaulting to undefined.
	* libbase/GC.{cpp,h}: Implement an heuristic to reduce
	  the number of collector runs. It is based on the number
	  of newly registered collectables since last run.
	  The threshold is set to 10 with a static const member
	  of the GC class. See http://gnashdev.org/wiki/index.php/ProfilingGC
	  for more informations.
	* gui/gui.cpp (fpsCounterTick): don't report an initial FPS of 0.

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/NullGui.{h,cpp}: implement quit(), for clean shutdown.
	* gui/gui.cpp (advance_movie): use quit() to exit

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gnash.cpp (parseCommandLine): support floating point argument
	  to -f switch.

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gui.{cpp,h}: add setFpsTimerInterval() public method,
	  change fpsCounterTick() interface to take no arg. Print total
	  number of frame advances on destruction. All available ifdef
	  GNASH_FPS_DEBUG.
	* gui/Player.{cpp,h}: add a setFpsPrintTime() public method.
	  Only available ifdef GNASH_FPS_DEBUG.
	* gui/gnash.cpp: Add -f switch for fps debugging prints
	  (long option was not trivial so didn't add it).
	  Note that if GNASH_FPS_DEBUG is not defined the -f switch
	  triggers an error.

2007-07-02 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gui.{cpp,h}: add fpsCounterTick() for FPS profiling

2007-07-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: add --enable-fps-debug switch to define
	  GNASH_FPS_DEBUG macro, to use for fuzy speed profiling.

2007-07-02 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* server/parser/sprite_definition.h: Allow soundsamples to be added
	  from sprites. Should the malformed-swf warning be removed?
	* backend/sound_handler_gst.cpp: Moved creation of a tempoary
	  variable to avoid an assertion failure.
	* backend/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Improved error handling.

2007-07-02 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.cpp: Disable MIT-SHM when pixel format is not recognized 

2007-07-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/GC.h: don't be verbose about GC by default.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: (add_interval_timer): take the Timer by
	  auto_ptr, add an optional second argument marking the timer as
	  internal (for use by xmlsocket/LoadVars and whichever other gnash
	  internal class in need for a timer). Internal timers will get a
	  negative identifier so to not introduce unexpected gaps in the
	  user-defined interval timers sequences. Fix bugs introduced in last
	  commit related to timer expiration and iterators invalidation.
	* server/timers.{cpp,h}: add some inspector functions, use VM::getTime
	  for timers (milliseconds).
	* server/asobj/: LoadVars.cpp, xmlsocket.cpp: update calls to
	  movie_root::add_interval_timer to mark these timers as internal.

2007-07-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/simple.exp: increment timeout from 4 to 5 minutes.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: store Timers into a map rather then
	  a vector, to allow for removal w/out loosing the timer identifier.
	  Scan a *copy* of the container so that clearing or adding new
	  intervals don't invalidate iterators.

2007-07-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/ref_counted.h: use 'long' for the ref count,
	  cleanup header inclusion, prepare for using an atomic
	  counter for thread safety (not enabled yet).
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.{cpp,h}: have MovieLoader
	  keep the boost::thread by auto_ptr for proper destruction.

2007-07-01 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* README: Added note on IRC.
	* gui/gnash.cpp: Added -V as shor for --version. Clean-up.

2007-07-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* COPYING: update to GPL version 3

2007-07-01 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* all over the place: Update to GPL version 3.

2007-07-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/GC.h: assert that only the main thread registers collectable
	  objects with the GC, or runs the collector.

2007-06-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/impl.cpp (clear): don't exit, try the proper cleanup way;
	  movie_def_impl loader should be ready, other threads likely aren't,
	  this patch would expose all places in need for proper implementation
	  of threads termination.
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.{cpp,h}: implement
	  loader thread cancelation request, wait for the thread
	  to terminate in MovieLoader destructor.

2007-06-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/ref_counted.h: remove inheritance of ref_counted
	  from GcResource, provide temporary isReachable/setReachable
	  to allow not reverting all GC-related additions to character
	  definitions and other possibly GcResource objects.
	* libbase/smart_ptr.h: have two versions of the intrusive_ptr
	  free functions: one for GcResource (do nothing) and one 
	  for ref_counted (add/drop ref). Enable GC by default, where
	  current version uses both RC and GC (GC only used for as_object)

2007-06-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/button_character_def.cpp: ok, let action_buffer leak,
	  as it seems deleting them in button_action dtor introduces a
	  segfault in our testusuite. Sorry for not running 'make check'
	  before committing.

2007-06-29 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.cpp: properly initialize new SHM variables
	* server/array.{h,cpp}: classes with virtual methods need a destructor,
	  don't they?   	
	
2007-06-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/button_character_def.{cpp,h}: don't let
	  gnash::button_action leak action_buffer objects.
	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp (getFontFilename): don't leak
	  the FcFontSet when finding a match.
	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}:
	  Do not call on_event(KILL_FOCUS) in the destructor, do
	  it on ::unload(). The less things destructors do, the better
	  (think GC..)

2007-06-27 Petr Pisar <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>

	* po/: Makefile.am, cs.po: Initial Czech translation.

2007-06-27 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/fb.cpp, gui/fltk_glue_agg.cpp, gui/gtk.cpp, gui/gui.cpp: set
	  correct _validbounds 	
	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.{cpp,h}: implemented shared memory image blitting

2007-06-26 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg_style.h: always premultiply image accessors
	  with alpha channel (partial fix for bug #20257)
	* backend/render_handler_agg.{cpp,h}, gui/fb.cpp: moved pixel format
	  detection code to AGG backend files (so it can be used by any GUI)   
	* gui/gtk_glue_agg.{cpp,h}: initial work for MIT-SHM support (not 
	  compiled in by default because there is much left to do)

2007-06-26 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/callFunction_test.c: testcase for ActionCallFunction,
	  Gnash fails.

2007-06-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/: edit_text_character.cpp, sprite_instance.cpp,
	  video_stream_instance.cpp, asobj/System.cpp:
	  Don't initialize the "constructor" member explicitly as that's
	  done by the builtin_function class instead. This patch fixes
	  the useless construction of 7 to 11 objects (otherwise 
	  deleted by first GC run).

2007-06-24 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/morph_test1.c: first testcase for morphs,
	  need a testrunner for checking the renderer, but might be enough for
	  testing GC at the moment.
	
2007-06-23 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.h: include <iostream> for proper definition
	  of output operator.

2007-06-23 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gtk.cpp: Use stock icons for some more menu options. Also,
	limit several lines to 80 characters.

2007-06-23 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.cpp (get_prototype): don't return the Object
	  interface when prototype is NULL with SWF version < 5.
	  Fixes the empty swf3 case with GC.

	in the QTDIR/bin directory for moc, in case the first moc in PATH
	is not the qt3 one.

2007-06-22 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/enumerate.as: more tests.

	  use of libintl.

2007-06-21 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	  Fixes segfault in movie reported in bug #19883, and also
	  shows that the GC model does it's job in this case.

2007-06-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/NullGui.{cpp,h}: implement setTimeout
	  call. fixes bug #20118.

	  surprisingly, all succeeded.
	
2007-06-18 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/key_event_test3.c,
	  testsuite/misc-ming.all/key_event_test3runner.cpp: the testrunner was

2007-06-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: (markReachableResources):
	  mark _frame0_chars as reachable. make check completes
	  successfully now.

2007-06-17 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test8.c: comments
	
2007-06-17 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	  enable and improve the 3rd attempt of timeline-control design, take 
	  ratio into consideration, which is not only used for morphs but also
	  for general characters in lots of swf files. Got 20 more successes, 
	  still need more tests and cleanups. see wiki.

2007-06-17 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/GC.h: fixed a misleading delete count for
	  the debugging mode. You can now see that in the UdoG
	  leaking case (empty function in first frame, empty second
	  frame) every GC collect run deletes 2 resources (most
	  likely an isolated chain of references in the RC case).

2007-06-17 Ann Barcomb <kudra@domaintje.com>

	* plugin/Makefile.am: Removed an incorrect comment.
	* doc/C/usermanual/install.xml: Added some information
	  inspired by the comments made in patch #5772.
	* INSTALL: Applied a modified version of patch #5772 by
	  Anders Juel Jensen.  

2007-06-16  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gui/gnash.cpp: Add the version of FFMPEG or GST to
	--version. Add the config options too.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Extract the config options so we can pass them
	to GCC, wo they become part of the output from --version.
	* libbase/image.cpp: Include memory so auto_ptr is defined.
	* macros/ffmpeg.m4: Define HAVE_FFMPEG_AVCODEC_H eben when not
	using AC_CHECK_HEADER.

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/: image.{cpp,h}, LoadThread.{cpp,h},
	  image_filters.cpp, noseek_fd_adapter.cpp,
	  reduce number of explicit deletes by using scoped pointers
	* server/asobj/Global.cpp: reduce explicit deletes...
	* server/asobj/: Sound.{cpp,h}, SoundFfmpeg.{cpp,h}, SoundGst.{cpp,h},
	  SoundMad.{cpp,h}: Use a smart pointer for the NetConnection 
	  reference, and implement markReachableResources to mark it.
	* server/asobj/xmlsocket.cpp (anydata): don't use a module-static
	  to keep track of leftovers !!

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ExecutableCode.h: implement markReachableResources
	  for executable code.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: mark resources reachable by 
	  the executable code in the global action queue.

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.{cpp,h}: do not explicitly
	  delete the shape_character_defs, rather keep by intrusive_ptr
	  (which means leave ownership to the GC in the GC case).

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/NetStream.{h,cpp}: implement markReachableResources.
	* server/asobj/gen-asclass.sh: updated template to include
	  a sample of a markReachableResources implementation.
	* server/asobj/LoadVars.cpp: implement markReachableResources
	  to properly mark event handlers and environment resources.
	* libbase/GC.h: don't be verbose about objects being marked,
	  classes not overriding markReachableResources, collectables
	  registered and deleted unless GNASH_GC_DEBUG > 1
	* server/timers.{cpp,h}: provide a markReachableResources to mark
	  function, target objet and args.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h} (markReachableResources): mark Timers
	  resources as being reachable; document what's marked in the function
	  declaration documentation.

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/server/: DisplayListTest.cpp, GetterSetterTest.cpp,
	  PropertyListTest.cpp: initialize gnash lib.

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.{cpp,h} (markReachableResources):
	  Set CharacterDictionary items as reachable !
	  (BTW, why are character defs managed pointers ?!)
	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp: initialize gnash code lib so
	  to work with GC on.

2007-06-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/button_character_instance.{cpp,h}: implement
	  markReachableResources to properly mark the state characters
	  and the character definition.
	* server/font.{cpp,h}: make texture_glyph a concrete class, no
	  more managed.
	* server/generic_character.h: implement markReachableResources to
	  properly mark the character definition.

2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h} (markReachableResources):
	  Mark the drawable canvas as reachable !
	  This fixes the empty movie case (no segfault) and also
	  the 2-frames simple leaking case reported by UdoG a long
	  time ago (first frame contains an empty function definition,
	  second frame is empty).

2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/BitmapMovieInstance.cpp, server/asobj/NetStream.cpp:
	  More warnings fixes.

2007-06-14 Kris Jurka <jurka@ejurka.com>

	* gui/Player.cpp, gui/gnash.cpp, server/as_environment.cpp,
	  server/as_function.cpp, server/as_value.cpp,
	  server/asobj/NetStream.cpp, server/asobj/xml.cpp,
	  server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp, server/vm/ActionExec.cpp:
	  Fix some compiler warnings. Applied patch #5927.

2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/triangulate_impl.h (poly_env<>::init): don't use
	  backslash to break strings (unneeded). See bug #20138.
	  
2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	First big pass on Garbage Collection. We can now use a compile-time
	define (GNASH_USE_GC) to select wheter GC or RF (ref-counting) is
	used. By default RC is used as GC is still bogus. Next step would
	be improving the GC mark functions to ensure needed resources aren't
	prematurely deleted by the GC. See in GC.h the GcResource class
	documentation for informations about how to do taht.

2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/: Makefile.am, GC.h: First draft at a garbage collector class.
	* cygnal/http.h: fix gnash::Network referencing, drop
	  'using namespace std'

2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gnash.cpp: add using namespace gnash here, since we're
	  out of the gnash namespace.
	* backend/render_handler_agg_bitmap.h,
	  backend/render_handler_agg_style.h,
	  libgeometry/snappingrange.h,
	  cygnal/http.h: don't use 'using namespace'
	  directive in headers !

2007-06-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Function.as: test local vars scope of
	  outer function to be kept alive by inner functions.
	* libbase/ref_counted.h: made destructor protected, to ensure no 
	  user is explicitly deleting a ref_counted object (propedeutic
	  to GC)
	* configure.ac: FREETYPE_{CFLAGS,LIBS} => FREETYPE2_{CFLAGS,LIBS)
	  in final reports/checks.
	* testsuite/misc-mtasc.all/Makefile.am: skip all tests if
	  prebuilt clip are not supported by the detected ming version.
	* po/: Makefile.am, it.po: initial work on an italian
	  translation (funny for a few minutes, but too boring
	  after a while ;)

2007-06-14 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.h: implement a get_bound() for
	  morphs, should fix an old displaying problem of morphs.
	  
2007-06-14 Hubert Figuiere <hfiguiere@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: look for freetype2, not freetype
	  (for pkg-config to be effective). Rename _CFLAGS and _LIBS
	  to be FREETYPE2, not FREETYPE
	* server/Makefile.am, server/parser/Makefile.am: 
	  Use FREETYPE2_{CFLAGS,LIBS}
	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp: use an FT_CONST macro
	  to switch between constness of Outline walker func between
	  freetype 2.1 (wants non-const) and 2.2 (wants const).

2007-06-14 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/character.h, 
	  server/dlist.h,

2007-06-13 Petr Pisar <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>

	* gui/gtk.cpp: internationalize menus. (patch #6006).

2007-06-13 Andrew Guertin <bugzilla@dolphinling.net>

	* configure.ac: removes the duplicate "Checking" and adds the missing
	  newline while checking for archiver type.
	* macros/agg.m4: print the missing "checking for AGG headers" line.
	  (patch #5933)

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextTest.c: put reduced margins
	  back, to verify no word wrap works.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (format_text): implement no word wra
	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.{cpp,h}: document coordinate space of
	  getGlyph output values and implement proper scaling between freetype
	  glyph EM units and our 1024 EM square.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/: font.{cpp,h}, Makefile.am, FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h},
	  FreetypeGlyphsProvider.{cpp,h}: renamed file and class since
	  we won't serve rendered glyphs anymore. Rendered glyphs can
	  always be obtained by rendering the shape_character_def,
	  the code should be buried somewhere in fontlib.cpp.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/font.cpp (add_os_font): use the advance value
	  computed by getGlyph, not getRenderedGlyph (the latter
	  is bogus).

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test8.c: xchec -> check.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/font.{cpp,h}: always maintain m_advance_table of the 
	  same size of the other two glyph info containers (should really
	  make a structure keeping all of them..). Fixes an testInvariant
	  failure with the device font selector (see DeviceFonts page
	  on wiki).

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: look for libfontconfig
	* Makefile.am: print fontconfig info on 'dumpconfig'
	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h}: implement font name
	  to filename matching using fontconfig, when available;
	  updated copyright info (enough hacking on it now..)
	* server/Makefile.am: add FONTCONFIG cflags and libs.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextTest.c: add another
	  text field using 'times' font.

2007-06-13 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am:
	  fix a typo(thank strk).
	  
2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: newlines are tokens with bourne shell !

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.cpp: fix build w/out libfreetype.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextTest.c:
	  Apply transformation to text characters.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gtk.cpp, server/FreetypeRasterizer.cpp,
	  server/fontlib.cpp, server/movie_root.cpp,
	  server/text.cpp: Reduced verbosity.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h}: Implement shape_character_def
	  output using DynamicShape; changed getGlyph method to also take
	  an 'advance' output parameter (toward deprecation of bitmap output).
	* server/font.cpp (add_os_glyph): update call to ::getGlyph.

2007-06-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h}: added interface
	  to fetch vectorial glyph (just a stub).
	* server/font.cpp (add_os_glyph): fetch both rasterized
	  and vectorial glyphs, survive to texture glyphs with a null
	  bound (space is one such glyph).
	* server/fontlib.cpp (draw_glyph): skip rendering of textured
	  glyphs with null bounds.
	* server/text.cpp (display_glyph_records): enable debugging by
	  default.

2007-06-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.cpp (getRenderedGlyph): don't assume
	  "suspeded_image" is not-null after creation of the bitmap_info_alpha
	  instance (those bitmap interfaces needs a big cleanup really...).
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextTest.c:
	  Test both embedded and device fonts.

2007-06-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: Look for libfreetype using GNASH_PKG_FIND
	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h}: use HAVE_FREETYPE_H,
	  use intrusive_ptr for bitmap_info, not auto_ptr; add missing
	  includes, make it actually buildable.
	* server/Makefile.am: Build FreetypeRasterizer
	* server/parser/Makefile.am: add FREETYPE_CFLAGS
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (format_text): stop relying
	  on font::get_glyph_count, as for device fonts count of glyph
	  is not known in advance (grows as needed).
	* server/font.{cpp,h}: Add private methods for initialization
	  and use of a freetype rasterizer; get_glyph_index() will now
	  try to create a missing glyph.
	* server/parser/bitmap_character_def.h: add forward declaration
	  for image::rgb

2007-06-12 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test8.c:
	  correctly set ratio, forgot in last commit.
	  
2007-06-12 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test8.c, Makefile.am:
	  new testcase for timeline control, focus on ratio.
	  
2007-06-11 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h}: 
	  Add missing stub for font filename finder method.

2007-06-11 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* gui/sdl_agg_glue.cpp: initialize member variables at construction, 
	  fix an abortion when loading nonexistent swf files.
	
2007-06-10 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* gui/kde{sup.h, .cpp}: Comment out debugging statements. Make
	setTimeout work. Quit KdeGui gracefully rather than calling
	exit(0). Avoid conversion compiler warnings. Switch class
	pointers to auto_ptr. Small code cleanups.
	* gui/kde_glue_agg{.cpp, .h}: Contain the rendering buffer in
	a scoped_array.

2007-06-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Makefile.am: klash.moc is a source file for the kde
	  gui.

2007-06-09 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* configure.ac: Allow the KDE GUI to be compiled against AGG.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Compile KDE/AGG files when requested.
	* gui/kde.cpp: Make the KDE GUI compatible with AGG by moving
	OpenGL-specific code into its respective glue. Also fix mouse
	movement in combination with scaling.
	* gui/kde_glue.h: Add stubs for AGG compatibility.
	* gui/kde_glue_opengl.cpp: run makeCurrent in the glue.
	* gui/kdesup.h: Allow the AGG glue to be used.
	* gui/kde_glue_agg{.cpp, .h}: Initial implementation of AGG
	glue for QT/KDE.

2007-06-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp (decodeFrame): do not
	  access a null decodedFrame (tgc: please check).

2007-06-08 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderFfmpeg.{cpp,h}: Store decodedFrame
	  in an auto_ptr to avoid possible leaks.

2007-06-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeRasterizer.{cpp,h}: Ported truetype
	  rasterizer from gameswf, cleaned up and documented
	  (as far as understood).

2007-06-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderGst.{cpp,h}: Store decodedFrame
	  in an auto_ptr to avoid leaks. Fix the case in which
	  there's NO decoded frame (ie: no gst-ffmpeg installed)
	  previously segfaulting by simply running
	  Video-EmbedSquareTestRunner.

2007-06-08 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* server/asobj/NetStreamFfmpeg.cpp: Don't leave the decoding
	  loop/thread until the queues are empty, or the media left
	  in the queues wont get played.
	* server/movie_root.cpp: Include action.h, not Action.h.
	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp: Changed the image copying,
	  and check if the decoded videoframe is bigger than expected.


2007-06-08 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/as_object.{h,cpp}: add a virtual on_event() for event handler. 
	* movie_root.{h,cpp}: add a new KeyListener class.
	* server/asobj/Key.{h ,cpp}, sprite_instance.cpp, edit_text_character.cpp,
	  button_character_instance.cpp: adopt new KeyListener interface.
	* server/character.h: change getUserDefinedEventHandler() from private to public.
	  all in all, merged two listener lists into one.
	  
2007-06-08 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Fixed an assertion fault
	  when non-mp3 audio was looping.

2007-06-07 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp: Free the av_frame after use.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: Adjust size of audio after decoding.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* macros/ffmpeg.m4: check for libgsm and add to FFMPEG_LIBS if
	  available.
	* testsuite/analyse-results.sh: don't forget to initialize
	  total_untested.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* doc/C/Makefile.am: distribute all XML files.
	* macros/docbook.m4: advertise --enable-docbook, not
	  --disable-docbook since it's disabled by default.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: disable klash if QT lib aren't found.
	* gui/Makefile.am: add kde_glue.h  in KDE_SRCS (hopefully this adds
	  to distribution).

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: hint user about using AGG if framebuffer gui is
	  requested.
	* server/Makefile.am, utilities/Makefile.am:
	  Moved the libgnashbackend dependency out of libgnashserver
	  and into the utilities/ dir. This is to avoid a circular
	  dependency I erroneously introduced with my last 
	  commit aimed at fixing bug #20110. This should be a better
	  fix.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/MovieTester.{cpp,h}: add a canTestVideo() method.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/NetStream-SquareTestRunner.cpp: don't
	  wait for Play.Stop event to be sent if video can't be tested
	  (ie: not supported by mad).

2007-06-07 Ann Barcomb <kudra@domaintje.com>

	* doc/C/usermanual/installation/building.xml: mention that
	  GNOME help is a possible documentation make target.  Completed
	  instructions for building documentation; added instructions for 
	  testing from old manual.
	* doc/C/usermanual/installation/feature_configuration.xml: The
	  default renderer isn't AGG. FLTK works. Spelling fixes.
	  Comment out TODO/FIXME sections, so that they are not visible 
	  to users, but can still be searched.
	* doc/C/usermanual/installation.xml: Changed the title of this
	  section.
	* doc/C/usermanual/installation/install.xml: Added information on
	   where Gnash installs.
	* doc/C/usermanual/installation/custompath_configuration.xml,

	  doc/C/usermanual/usage/gnashrc.xml.
	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Replace the old usermanual + developer
	  information with the new usermanual.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/Makefile.am: add libgnashbackend to libserver LDADD.
	  Fixes bug #20110.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp (checkPixel): print an UNTESTED
	  message if no renderers were initialized. This gives you
	  a feel about how many tests are we failign to run when building
	  with a renderer that doesn't provide testing facilities.
	* testsuite/analyse-results.sh: print untested in report.
	* testsuite/MovieTester.h: add a canTestRendering() method.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Video-EmbedSquareTestRunner.cpp: 
	  Don't run the pixel checking part if MovieTester can't test
	  rendering. Raise an UNTESTED label instead, so it's reported.

2007-06-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libgeometry/snappingrange.h: initialize all members in the
	  templated copy ctor.

2007-06-07 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler.cpp: Fixed a warning.
	* backend/sound_handler_gst.cpp: Small cleanup.
	* libbase/embedVideoDecoder{Ffmpeg, Gst}.cpp: Made more robust, can
	  now handle if render image format is NONE. Should fix bug #20111.

2007-06-07 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: better version of previous patch;
	  gets rid of WIDTH_FUDGE too 	

2007-06-07 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: shift text by 2 pixels, 
	  fixes bug #17954

2007-06-07 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: improved call_frame_actions(), 
	  avoid using possibly invalidated interators.
	
2007-06-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loader.cpp (fixme_loader): warn only once for each
	  unimplemented tag found in SWF streams during a run.

2007-06-06 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: add checks for known scale 	
	  and preset scale to 1:1 so that "make check" succeeds again

2007-06-06 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/embedVideoDecoder.h: Added docs and made decodeFrame 
	  return a auto_ptr.
	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderFfmpeg.{cpp,h}: Made decodeFrame 
	  return a auto_ptr.
	* libbase/embedVideoDecoderGst.{cpp,h}: Made decodeFrame 
	  return a auto_ptr, and fixed a deadlock.
	* server/video_stream_instance.cpp: embedVideoDecoder::decodeFrame 
	  now returns a auto_ptr, adjust to that.

2007-06-06 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: dynamic cast check 	

2007-06-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/eventSoundTest1-Runner.cpp: don't test sound
	  if sound is not supported.

2007-06-06 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: apply stage scaling to matrix,
	  don't multiply each coordinate (should improve rendering performance) 	

2007-06-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/MovieTester.{cpp,h}: Don't abort if sound support wasn't
	  compiled in. Add a canTestSound() method to query that capability.

2007-06-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: If no --enable-media was specified, use the first
	  detected one in this order: ffmpeg/gst/mad. This is to allow
	  ./configure with no args to be more failsafe (useful on 'make
	  distcheck'). If you guys like this patch I'd backport to 0.8 branch.

2007-06-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/samples/Makefile.am: distribute subshapes.swf, as we're
	  now using it for testing purposes.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am: VideoEmbed-SquareTest.swf
	  depends on testsuite/media/square.flv ! Fixes bug #20090.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/NetStream-SquareTest.c: Fixed test for
	  bytesTotal since the .flv was actually updated... Fixes bug #20096.
	* configure.ac: don't set CXXFLAGS as a side-effect of the SIZET_FMT
	  tests if not already set by user.
	* Makefile.am: Add print of CXXFLAGS at 'make dumpconfig' time.

2007-06-05 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* testsuite/media/square.flv: Changed the movements in the movie to
	  be more fluent so that testing is easier.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Video-EmbedSquareTestRunner.cpp: Check if
	  the video really does play.

2007-06-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: support --without-extensions.
	* testsuite/samples/: Makefile.am, subshapes-TestRunner.cpp:
	  Test runner for subshapes.swf (see bug #20084).
	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp (addTestingRenderer): register the first
	  and only tested renderer immediately, to be more tolerant about
	  limitations in the core lib preveing hot-swap of renderers.

2007-06-05 Ann Barcomb <kudra@domaintje.com>

	* doc/C/usermanual/usage/gnashrc.xml: Copy Sandro's commit
	  1.3435 of doc/C/gnashrc.xml to the new gnashrc.xml
	* many files: Changed my email address

2007-06-05 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: correct matrix transformation
	  for rotated video; switch to /cloning/ image accessor to
	  make edges smooth for rotated video	
	
2007-06-05 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/as_object.h: change operator "==" to "=", should fix a typo.
	  
2007-06-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* README: some opcode and classes are actually implemented now.

2007-06-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/video_stream_instance.{cpp,h}: register Video AS class
	  interface and provide class initialization.
	* server/asobj/: Global.cpp, Makefile.am, Video.{cpp,h}: Drop Video file, video
	  class is now implemented in video_stream_instance.cpp
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/NetStream-SquareTest.c: don't expect
	  failures due to video stream character NOT being a real Video
	  object.

2007-06-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/NetStream-SquareTest.c: set SWF rate back to
	  an high value to allow for testing pixel color and also testing with
	  eyes what's hard to test when nothing is shown due to Gnash not
	  supporting sub-SWF rate videos; Scale video by 120% and rotate 45
	  degrees clockwise to verify video transform
	  bugs (not automated yet); documented expected behaviour; add 
	  tests for matrix transforming properties.

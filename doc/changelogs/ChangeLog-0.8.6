	Implement part of an interface for VideoInput, add notes on what's required
	for the rest of it.
	
	The advantages of this are that it is possible to implement Camera as a Relay,
	to assign the MediaHandler dynamically, to drop ifdefs, to make it possible
	to implement an ffmpeg VideoInput class, and generally to make the code
	into a half-way useful design.
	
	The disadvantage is that many unit tests had to be dropped. Because the
	design has changed (and needs to change much more) they weren't useful.

	test now only uses the public interface of VideoInput (except in a few
	cases).
	
	Implementation-specific requirements are not tested. Instead assertions are
	used in the implementation.
	
	Tests for bad values have been removed. There is no way to set dimensions from
	ActionScript. Instead, a width/height is requested and the VideoInput class
	should select an appropriate available one.
	
	The tests should be replaced with generic tests when this functionality is
	implemented.

	for months.

2009-08-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename Proxy to Relay for consistency with swfdec's similar class. They did
	invent it first, after all.
	
	Introduce ActiveRelay for native objects that require an update on each
	advance. Implement for Sound, LoadVars, XML, NetConnection, and NetStream.
	Allows subclassing of these built-in classes, fixing blip.tv (bug #27214).
	
	This involves some changes to XML and LoadVars that aren't automatically 
	tested, so there may be some uncaught regressions. Some were spotted and
	fixed during manual testing.

2009-08-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add note.

2009-08-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	It was already tested a bit. Fix those tests.

2009-08-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't rely on as_object virtual methods. Fixes sendAndLoad again. The exact

	Cleanups, reduce code duplication.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanup.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use anonymous namespace.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Really drop statics.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop statics in flash/events.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	tmp

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use registration function for more built-in classes.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	No static properties.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use registration functions more widely.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use registration function.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Get functions the right way round.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop more static prototypes.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop more subclasses and static prototypes.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop more subclasses, use registerBuiltinClass.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	some places.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove statics from ContextMenu.

2009-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement more flexible and less verbose class for function arguments.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add Proxy member of as_object to handle type-dependent data. This replaces
	the practice of using subclasses and allows the type to be assigned by
	a constructor. It also removes the need for static prototypes.
	
	Currently String, Boolean, Number, and Date are implemented like this, passing
	new and old tests.
	
	Test super more and correct the implementation so that construction of
	objects derived from native classes works (as long as these use the proxy
	object implementation).
	
	Implement various native functions.
	
	Further cleanups are needed.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct ASconstructor implementation, passing tests.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement Boolean and Number functions as natives. Register them.
	
	Implement ASconstructor.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't store super's __proto__ and __constructor__ in as_super; store the
	super object instead and retrieve them when needed (tested to change
	during a constructor).
	
	Use an ugly hack to make sure super calls count as an instantiation. Still
	no idea how to do this properly.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test super more.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More version-dependent tests.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests pass now that String is constructed more correctly.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't ruin AMF serialization. Optimize (for readability) algorithm slightly.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add generic function for checking object types.
	
	Drop duplicated code for convert_to_primitive and to_primitive. Any possible
	speed benefit of convert_to_primitive (unlikely) is outweighed by the
	annoyance of having two identical algorithms, and can easily be optimized
	again anyway.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanup.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use Proxy for Date and String.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Handle corner case (super not implemented correctly).

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Not all versions pass yet. More tests.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Temp

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests in swfdec testsuite now pass.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Old test now passes.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	String.prototype.valueOf is not the same as Object.prototype.toString.
	Implement it correctly. Implement Object.prototype.toString correctly.
	Move to Object.cpp, as it shouldn't be used anywhere else.
	
	New tests for toString and valueOf. Passes in swfdec testsuite and for
	old and new tests in actionscript.all.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Version-dependent return.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct expected result.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests, correct totals.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Get totals correct.

2009-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test Object.prototype.toString.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop get_primitive_value altogether. The specs misleadingly suggest that
	Object.valueOf returns a different primitive depending on the type of the
	object. In fact, each Object type (String, Boolean etc) has a different
	valueOf function that only works with an instance of that particular object.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop get_primitive_value, which did the wrong thing and was probably never
	used.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't use get_primitive_value in Number_as.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop more useless code.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop get_numeric_value, particularly as a virtual function of as_object,
	as it's not used.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a polymorphic proxy object instead of an as_object subclass type to
	implement the Boolean type.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement difference between native and built-in functions.
	
	Drop static data usage for built-in functions (except those that Gnash
	implements more like a native function).
	
	Various cleanups and fixes.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop try/catch mess and incorrect log messages.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a single function for creating and registering built-in objects.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop more static data.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	New tests, passes.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop class and type for CustomActions, as it's just a simple object.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use more passed-in prototypes.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass for builtin function.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	New ASconstructor tests.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Separate native and builtin functions properly. Register Function.call
	and Function.apply as native.
	
	Experiment with String native constructor (not really finished).

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Version dependent.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another pass.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passes.

	Introduce NativeFunction for real native functions.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move function property construction out of builtin_function and into
	Globals, where it is clearer and easier to maintain.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Header.

2009-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't insist on prototype being an object.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	SWF5 passes now.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unnecessary Stage_as type.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop type.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't modify functions by adding a prototype property when called as a
	constructor.
	
	Expose constructor property to swf5 as well (was tested, but not implemented).

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use this pointer when constructing Color.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused code.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't duplicate so much code in constructInstance(). Allow for possibility
	of constructors operating on 'this' pointer.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a separate flag for isInstantiation, as the this_ptr really shouldn't
	be 0 for built-in functions.

2009-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More instance and prototype tests.

	Small changes to TextField class to avoid errors with INLINE definition.

2009-08-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Revert change to actionscript.all/enumerate.as. enumerate2 is not a typo,
	but a crucial part of the test - which is why it fails now. Update ming if
	it fails to compile.

2009-08-13  Jon Crider  <jon.crider@gmail.com>

	Do Color class correctly.

2009-08-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Handle target string as well as MovieClip argument. Test that the processing
	happens on each call, not on construction.

2009-08-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Get properties more correct, but not completely due to the over-complicated
	way Gnash adds some of them.

2009-08-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add missed check for MovieClip existence. Use global to create object.

2009-08-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	As ASnative to named strings.

2009-08-12  Ben Limmer  <limmer@colorado.edu>

	fixed test cases to conform with Adobe player and changed some implementations to Camera and Microphone classes

2009-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't make BitmapMovie::advance a no-op, or it breaks things.

2009-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Call MovieClip::advance() in BitmapMovie::advance(). Fixes the tagesschau
	atlas SWF again.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups and improvements to constructor.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up the String constructor at the expense of making its prototype
	uglier (static for both AVM1 and AVM2).

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop default argument to Number_as constructor.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up Number class.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	various files.
	
	Add tests for those kind of conversions.
	
	Fix a bug in XML's and LoadVars's sendAndLoad method.
	
	Newly-added swfdec tests pass.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	works again.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the correct URL for sendAndLoad methods.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't use ensureType in Mouse.show or Mouse.hide. It now makes tests fail
	in actionscript.all/Instance.as because the function returns undefined when
	used as a constructor if not called as a member function. That was never
	correct, and was exposed as a bug by allowing AS constructors to return
	undefined.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rearrange file.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use helper function to catch exceptions where necessary.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop init_number_instance.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop init_boolean_instance.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Throw AS constructor exceptions back to the caller instead of handling
	them.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Construct all basic object types (String, Number, Boolean) in the same
	way. Throw exception if the type has been deleted, so that the constructor
	returns an undefined value.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Allow construction of objects to fail when an exception is thrown.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Gnash fails the new tests still.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Return correct type of object for null or undefined values.

2009-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test constructing objects from undefined or null.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Various improvements to soldumper.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improvements to soldumper from Stefano Sabatini.

2009-08-08  Stefano Sabatini  <stefasab@gmail.com>

	Make soldumper exit with 1 in case of missing arguments.

2009-08-08  Stefano Sabatini  <stefasab@gmail.com>

	Print usage notice on cout rather than on cerr when it makes sense.
	Allows for example for:
	soldumper -h | grep -l 
	operations.

2009-08-08  Stefano Sabatini  <stefasab@gmail.com>

	Make usage do not exit, as the application exit code depends on the
	context where it is used.

2009-08-08  Stefano Sabatini  <stefasab@gmail.com>

	Make usage() take an ostream as parameter, this allows for printing on
	cout if opportune.

2009-08-08  Stefano Sabatini  <stefasab@gmail.com>

	Avoid a forward declaration for the usage() function.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix NetConnection.connect properly so it runs potlatch and passes the remoting
	tests. Change NetConnection.as so that it doesn't ruin the remaining tests
	by attempting a sandbox-restricted connection. Note lack of tests for
	genuine connections.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indent.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't attempt connection to rtmp url, as it depends on
	sandbox settings that the Adobe player doesn't have and makes the
	test unverifiable on that player.
	
	A new test is needed for testing what happens when there is a connection,
	as it does affect status and return values.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix second bug in NetConnection.connect so that potlatch works again.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Daily fix for testsuite mess-ups.
	
	The classes.all testsuite is still a mess, doesn't distinguish enough
	between AS2 and AS3, and consequently still fails.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do NOT disable tests.
	
	Test here as well that setCursor exists. 

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Stub setCursor again.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another unused variable warning.

2009-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix unused variable warning by commenting out unused code.

	expand the list of supported protocols.

2009-08-07  Rob Savoye  <rob@welcomehome.org>

2009-08-07  Ben Limmer  <limmer@colorado.edu>

	updated docs

2009-08-07  Ben Limmer  <limmer@colorado.edu>

	improved implementations of camera_as and microphone_as and associated testcases

2009-08-07  Bob Naugle  <bobbynaugs@gmail.com>

	Fix segfault when typing in an empty textfield

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Separate Object prototype and class entirely for each VM. This still uses
	the VM singleton and the prototypes are still static until the prototype
	is stored properly, and until getObjectInterface() takes an argument. This
	temporary hack shows there are no ill effects as all tests still pass.
	
	Make more objects non-static, so that they are not shared between the
	two VMs. There are still many to go.
	
	Make some changes to VM and Machine construction to address problems created
	by VM's ownership of Machine. This is not nearly robust enough, but serves
	as a temporary measure until the AS resources are properly separated.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make constructor function non-static. Don't replicate interface to 
	class. No idea why that was done all over the place, because it's wrong.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make Error constructor non-static.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make class non-static.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused constructor. Make things non-static.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make the Object class function non-static too, so that AVM2 doesn't share
	that with AVM1 either.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initialize a separate Object.prototype for each Machine. This currently
	uses the VM singleton. It also fails two AS3 tests.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	SDL_OpenAudio changes the desired SDL_AudioSpec, which can lead it to
	fail if a sound device becomes unavailable between calls to openAudio().
	Reset the SDL_AudioSpec on each call. Fixes bug #27071 (thanks to
	Ed Martin for the bug report and the patch).

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't delete sounds when restarting a SWF. Fixes bug #27132.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do not delete sounds when restarting the sound_handler. They are needed
	for the next run, as we don't parse the SWF again.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix return bug.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't omit to return the calculated value.

2009-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused glyphsnonconst method. If such access is ever needed
	(hopefully not), it can simply overload glyphs() and the compiler will
	choose the appropriate version.

2009-08-06  Bob Naugle  <bobbynaugs@gmail.com>

	Fix certain scrolling errors, and upload haXe TextField test case

2009-08-06  Bob Naugle  <bobbynaugs@gmail.com>

	Gnash no longer segfaults when focus is given to an empty TextField.

2009-08-06  Bob Naugle  <bobbynaugs@gmail.com>

	Fix a small bug. First character is no longer displayed after it's deleted.

2009-08-06  Bob Naugle  <bobbynaugs@gmail.com>

	Documentation, cleanups, and a few minor fixes.

2009-08-06  Sharad Desai  <ssdesai1@gmail.com>

	Framework for anchor tag, as well as partial implementation of TextFormat url and target properties

2009-08-06  Sharad Desai  <ssdesai1@gmail.com>

	Framework for anchor tag, as well as partial implementation of TextFormat url and target properties

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement the AS interface of Microphone and Camera correctly. This
	does not change any of the Audio or Video input code, just the way the
	class works in ActionScript. It now passes all the actionscript.all tests
	and the swfdec properties tests.
	
	Test Camera properties better in our own tests.
	
	Run Camera and Microphone tests with ffmpeg again. There is only one
	media-handler-dependent test, and it can be handled individually.
	
	The classes.all/Microphone_as test fails 6 tests in Gnash, but fails 10
	in the Adobe player. It needs fixing...
	
	Add notes on implementation.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	One last pass.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passes in swfdec testsuite.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Camera and Microphone are not hidden in SWF5.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add missing Camera properties, some minor corrections. Passes swfdec testsuite.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Camera.names is also static.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't add AS3 currentFPS for AS2 class.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test Camera properties better.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passes in swfdec.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor fix to Microphone properties so we pass the swfdec testsuite too.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up more.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another test pass.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct AS camera interface.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor corrections to tests. There aren't enough here.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Get case right in the test, or it's pretty useless. We test case for SWF6
	elsewhere.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix typo (silenceTimeout, not silenceTimeOut), so that tests pass.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix most AS interface errors.
	
	Microphone has a constructor that returns an object with some microphone
	properties.
	
	Microphone::get() is not a constructor, but a static accessor, so should
	be attached to the class (constructor function).
	
	Non-static AS members should not be attached to the class
	(constructor function).
	
	Properties are added to the prototype when Microphone::get is called.
	
	Make the class function non-static.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Restore tests to correct versions. Please fix Gnash rather than breaking
	the tests.
	
	The classes.all tests for Camera and Microphone also need attention. 
	Microphone fails on the PP, the Camera one fails if no camera is present.
	
	Fix various compiler warnings, many of them real bugs.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Revert bogus tests (failed in the pp) to the correct versions, which fail
	in Gnash.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do the same for AudioInputGst.

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	with them.

	Fix unused variable warnings. Fix signed/unsigned. To check container
	bounds, use ">= size()", not "> size() - 1".

2009-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	C++ style. Initialize _gain for ffmpeg as well.

	Implemented Stage.showMenu -
	Currently gnash ignores any changes to the showMenu property unless the option
	'ignoreShowMenu' is set to false in the gnashrc file. The default for this
	option is 'true'. I still need to add this option to the default gnashrc file,
	and add it to the documentation. If 'ignoreShowMenu' is set to false, an
	abbreviated context (right click) menu will be shown instead of gnash's full
	menu. This abbreviated menu is similar to pp's menu in this case.
	
	As per the discussion on the gnash-dev mailing list, this option will be
	ignored by default.

2009-07-21  Jon Crider  <jon.crider@gmail.com>

	Finished implementation of showMenu. Only works in gtk. Must add 'set ignoreShowMenu' to gnashrc file.

	Drop header headers.

2009-07-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass an ObjectURI to all init methods. This makes them more flexible in
	that the callers (generally the Global objects) decide the name and namespace
	of the created object. AS3 objects such as SimpleButton and XMLDocument with
	different names, and most others with different namespaces, need this
	functionality.
	
	It also introduces a possibility of identifying prototypes for central
	registration, but I'm still not sure why this should be necessary.

2009-07-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename as_prop_flags to PropFlags. Add DefaultFlags constant to as_object
	to make code more concise. Most classes are going to need this constant
	in order to use the namespace argument of init_member.
	
	Move ctors to the top of as_object.cpp. Define constant.

2009-07-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass the ObjectURI to all init functions. Callers now control where the
	created class is attached.

2009-07-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update documentation
	
	Introduce ObjectURI. This will be passed to initialization functions to

	Don't expose AS constructors outside the class. This was designed to mimic

	- gnash still segfaults after test when test uses TextField (my apologies, fixing now)

2009-07-14  Jon Crider  <jon.crider@gmail.com>

	Implemented System_security_allowDomain. Added vector data structures and accessor functions to System_as.cpp to store domain name strings for allowing data access to swf's. This currently does nothing in gnash since we don't deal with inter-swf access in the same way as Adobe.
	Added unit tests to testsuite/network.all to test these new functions. This test probably doesn't need to go here but the structure of the Makefile was such that it was easy to add it in here (as per Rob's suggestion).

	Some scroll functionality
	Known issues:
	insertion of newline at end of visible lines with trailing glyphs does not immediately display trailing glyphs
	UP/DOWN keys use glyph counts as position, should use x-coordinate
	UP/DOWN keys do not remember the line position you started from, they are reset every time

	Replace over 1000 calls to the builtin_function ctor with
	Global_as::createFunction and Global_as::createClass, so that we can change
	the ctor to take almost any argument (as long as Global_as can access it)
	by changing a few lines instead of all uses.
	
	This also makes implementing the AS3 constructors correctly into a single
	central change rather than editing each class separately.
	
	The Global_as base class, not the VM, will serve as the point of reference
	for ActionScript, because it is designed to work for both VM versions.
	
	The flash.display classes are still not finished as they require a bit more
	attention. The basic classes needed by as_value (String, Boolean, Number,
	Object) also do not use the Global_as functions because as_value has
	no access to the necessary resources.
	
	Replace usage of member functions for as_object, fn_call and as_environment
	with non-member, non-friend functions. This has the same purpose, namely
	allowing refactoring by touching a small number of functions instead of
	several hundred separate places.

2009-07-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the Global_as createClass function to get almost all global

	Get the correct SWF version for MovieClip.

2009-07-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make all access to VM, string_table, movie_root, and RunResources happen
	through non-member, non-friend functions as preparation for refactoring
	(and generally making such changes easier). The three classes that
	provide access to those are: fn_call, as_environment, and as_object.
	
	Make as_object constructors explicit when they take a prototype, or the
	compiler allows passing pointers to functions that have a ref-to-const
	argument. That causes disasters.

2009-07-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop override of virtual function.

2009-07-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make the renderer no longer a singleton. It is now part of the RunResources
	for a single Gnash run, and must be set before parsing.
	
	Rename RunInfo to RunResources to reflect what it does.
	
	Most complications arise from the use of BitmapInfos stored in the
	renderers. Without these, there would be no need to use the renderer during
	parsing, and it could theoretically be passed to movie_root::display()
	and externally owned. However, as AS from SWF version 8 needs a renderer
	to draw to an internal buffer (not necessarily the same one as the main
	renderer), it also makes sense to have it in the RunResources.
	
	This will break GUIs that I can't test, and others are only provisionally
	changed so that they compile and run. Updates from their authors are
	welcome. The depth parameter to GUIs is replaced with the RunInfo reference.
	This removes functionality from the SDL gui (though the bit depth parameter
	passed to all Guis and used only in the SDL one is hard-coded in Player.cpp and
	never changed). It can be restored either using an environment
	variable (preferred) or adding the bit depth to the RunResources.
	
	It should be relatively easy to select the renderer at runtime now.

2009-07-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix testsuite.

2009-07-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-07-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make line colours easier to distinguish and add pixel checking to the
	test runner.

2009-07-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add test for Gnash's line style failure to DrawingApiTest (drawing 3).

2009-07-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do a swfmill version check to avoid bogus failures in the testsuite.

2009-07-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Check swfmill version, log it, warn if it's too low when building AVM2,
	and don't run AS3 tests when swfmill doesn't support it.

2009-07-07  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	DSOEXPORT-attrib

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Prevent a crash in AS3 TextFields (without giving a real fix).

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix namespace lookups.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Error is in the global, not flash.errors namespace.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test passes now.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Yes, push constructed property.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the namespace too when looking up properties to construct, instead of
	using the first matching object name. Fixes as3compile.all/lookup.swf,
	hopefully for everyone.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused classes headers.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another test.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	AS3 classes are not functions, but become global objects with a constructor
	function. Implement MovieClip more like this (it may be more correct to
	use the MovieClip prototype object) as an example; more testing and
	improvement is needed before this is done everywhere.
	
	CONSTRUCTSUPER now looks for the constructor function, which fixes behaviour
	for built-in class. Eventually CONSTRUCTSUPER and CONSTRUCTPROP opcodes
	should only do this, and not expect properties to be a constructor function
	at all.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test passes.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests for MovieClip.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make AS3 MovieClip class a prototype object with ctor, not a function.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop all the unnecessary stuff from Keyboard_as.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't use VM singleton unnecessarily.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop debugging.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up, comment.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Check inheritance from built-in MovieClip class.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename variables.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	The Machine has no as_environment::ScopeStack any more.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused and obsolete functions.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passing inheritance tests, some new tests.

2009-07-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Object prototypes appear never to be functions in AS3 (unlike AS2), so
	always use the constructor property in CONSTRUCTSUPER.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Construct a MovieClip when asked to; passes some tests in as3compile.all.
	
	Add all flash.text AS3 classes to ClassHierarchy except TextColor, which
	isn't stubbed and conflicts with TextFormat.textColor anyway.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add all text classes to ClassHierarchy.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Allow AS3 creation of MovieClips.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do namespace importing and class lookup properly.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename abc_block to AbcBlock.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add some class documentation to abc_block.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Always use global, not ABC names, for classes. Lookup package (currently
	all non-private) namespaces using the global name, which has the effect
	of "importing" external namespaces into the ABC block.
	
	This makes it possible to look up classes only using the ABC block's 
	resources. It also prevents potential name conflicts when adding classes to
	existing namespaces and makes it easier to locate classes using a global
	name.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move locateClass functions together.

2009-07-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use abc block string pool for logging to make errors clearer.

2009-07-02  Si Liu  <liusi_in_lab@hotmail.com>

	Clean up, add dump() function for debugging.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up, add alternative lookup method for debugging / testing.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improve parse logging.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Stub QName implementation.
	
	Find properties more successfully in AVM2.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add some more tests for constructor and prototype of QName.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct typo in QName, attach properties to instance not prototype. Passes
	in QName.as.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add QName_as to the flash.am, as asobj/Makefile.am isn't used (but is
	still there...)

	Drop accessibility and desktop packages.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add stubbed QName class.

	Correct comments.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct super types for DisplayObject subclasses.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add xchecks.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add test for QName.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use get_member in find_prop_strict, as getMember doesn't distinguish between
	not found and undefined.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Dump namespace in the other dump function too.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add namespace to member dump.

2009-07-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Mark the AVM2 global as reachable.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't try to instantiate classes when there is no ABC block loaded (Machine
	was not initiated, perhaps due to faulty ABC parsing).

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Really don't execute ABC tags that aren't parsed correctly.

	Don't look in as_environment for objects.

	Stop faking classes.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Check a namespace exists before using it. Look in global namespace only
	if it doesn't (not verified).

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Look up global classes properly.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Global is the public namespace 0, not an anonymous one.

2009-07-01  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix unused variable warning

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Create a separate Global object for each VM. This split means that changing
	one object will no longer cause changes in the other. However, as we still
	mostly use the same objects, changing an object prototype will still
	result in changes to both machines, which is wrong.
	
	The AVM1 Global object no longer has AVM2 objects; the AVM2 one no longer
	has AVM1 objects, but does not yet have all AVM2 objects.
	
	Use ClassHierarchy to register objects. Enable namespace support in
	ClassHierarchy. The package object system is no longer used for AVM2; it
	treated flash and subpackages as objects when they should be namespaces.
	Packages for AS3 (not AS2!) can be removed.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Expose ClassHierarchy (hopefully temporarily).

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update comments.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop mIsAS3.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Be stricter about namespaces now that avm1 values are properly declared
	in the global namespace.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct typo.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add more avm2 classes.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add flash.errors namespace. Consistent indentation.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct global properties for avm2 and avm1. Put all avm1 classes in the
	global namespace (adding more wastes memory).
	
	Add correct namespaces for all avm2 classes in the list.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop a PROPNAME.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop logging for finding the Object prototype bug.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't pass the Object prototype to declare_{native,extension}_function's
	base ctor (as_function), as this sets Object.prototype.constructor to
	that function on each declaration!
	
	This only worked before because object_class_init was called *after* all the
	classes were declared, thus setting Object.prototype.constructor to the
	correct value.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	declare_native_function doesn't need to know about extensions.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initialize Sprite class.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop logging, remove obsolete comment.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Create separate AVM1 and AVM2 Global objects, each owned by the respective
	VM and owning its own ClassHierarchy. This is necessary to allow runs with
	mixed VM versions.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add libltdl as an include (should probably be temporary).

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop ClassHierarchy member as this should be owned by the Global classes.
	Return the appropriate Global class according to VM version.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Get the ClassHierarchy from Machine using an ugly hack (to be improved).

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move class definition up. Correct stubPrototype usage.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop ClassHierarchy member of Machine; get it from the global object instead.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass ClassHierarchy to asNamespace::stubPrototype() to avoid using VM
	singleton. This could also be avoided by storing a reference to ClassHierarchy
	in asNamespace.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename some types. Provide a constructor for NativeClass. Move list of
	classes from ClassHierarchy to Global as the available classes depend on
	the global object.
	
	Do not initialize AS3 classes (int, Namespace) for AVM1.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename Global to AVM1Global. Add documentation about the two global
	objects. Define AVM2Global.

2009-06-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initialize the Machine's global object on construction as a precursor to
	using separate global objects for AVM1 and AVM2.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct libbase dependencies for libtool 1.5.x builds, fixing parallel
	builds.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Some loaded / total bytes related fixes.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't replicate interface to class. I don't know why we do this all
	over the place.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	XML tests pass.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	New tests, passes for old expected failures.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the loadableobject methods for getBytesLoaded, getBytesTotal.

	Use the loadableobject methods for getBytesLoaded, getBytesTotal.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update _bytesTotal and _bytesLoaded properties after each advance().
	
	Add _bytesTotal and _bytesLoaded members to LoadableObjects (XML, LoadVars)
	on call to load().
	
	Make getBytesTotal() and getBytesLoaded() return the value of the respective
	properties.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Silence unused parameter warnings.

2009-07-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	NetStream probably does support SSL.

2009-06-29  Udo Giacomozzi  <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	Get rid of delay loop because of the new heartbeat interval (correct timing is up to advance() now).
	Make check_mouse() and check_keyboard() return true on activity even if that's completely unnecessary now since there is no delay loop anymore... ;-)

	Minor change to as3compile.all testsuite.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop things from Dejagnu now that it only has static methods.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Stop faking classes so that error reporting is more accurate; it's not
	necessary for passing current testcases any more.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improve parsing algorithm slightly. Minor cleanups and improved logging.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add note about method return type. Don't fail on unknown return type, as
	Gnash is doing this wrong. Don't fail on unknown parameter type; Gnash may
	not be doing this wrong, but it is unhelpful. Log and continue.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix some segfaults due to executing ABC tags that aren't completely parsed.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Failure to parse classes will leave invalid pointers, which tend to
	cause segfaults. Fixes to class parsing may prevent this situation, or
	resizing the class container on failure, but for now we will not
	execute any ABC block where parsing failed.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename test appropriately.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename scope2 test to stack1 so it reflects what it actually tests.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Go the whole hog with setting Global as the prototype in the absence of
	any testing.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	The last script, not the first, is the entry script. Set all script
	prototypes to global as the apparently most likely implementation; there
	is no easy way of testing it yet.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do slot reservation more correctly. Tests from all as3compile versions should
	now run properly.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make sure Global is the prototype of the entry script. This produces the
	behaviour expected when the entry script is used, though the semantics of
	setting it as a 'prototype' needs thought.
	
	Use reserveSlot instead of init_member where we just want to reserve a slot.
	
	Register member classes with the global name, not the local one.
	
	as3compile tests should now all work.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up logging.

2009-06-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-06-27  Andrea Palmat?  <andrea@amigasoft.net>

	Some AmigaOS4 audio/video changes

2009-06-27  john  <john@acid>

	Correct bit per pixel check

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make AVM2 scope stack and stack usage stricter and more correct by dropping
	left-over items on return from functions, not dropping items before
	entering functions, and using the whole scope stack for lookup.  SafeStack 
	was ideal for this, but wasn't being used correctly.
	
	This also fixes crashes when the VM accessed deleted items that were left in
	the stack after function returns. It also removes the need for some ugly hacks
	in the AVM2 code. It should be possible to clean it up further with
	more testing.
	
	Add limited regression test for stack usage so it doesn't break again.
	
	Add the rest of the infrastructure for trace testing in misc-swfmill.all
	(may be better in its own directory). Fix various errors in the Makefile
	so that all the tests are built, run, and cleaned.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do seek on both types of return instead of in different places or twice.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add the test-runner generator, minor corrections to Makefile so that
	the tests run.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Create and run the test runner.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passing trace tests.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add a reduced testcase version so that one passes at all for regression
	testing.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Set the stack size correctly, that is dropping left-over items on return
	and restoring the pre-function-call stack.
	
	Push the object to the stack on CONSTRUCTPROP.
	
	This makes the non-automated misc-swfmill.all scope1.swf test work
	(except for tracing an incorrect string for objects and classes) and
	introduces no regressions in the as3compile tests.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop load_function function and do it in executeFunction instead for
	clarity.
	
	Check the stack size in completeName() first so as not to cause
	StackExceptions.
	
	Store and restore stack sizes after executeFunction (not yet using
	saveState()).

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	OpPopStack doesn't exist; it's OpPop and it does cause an error after all.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the scope stack properly: do not push objects to it for function calls,
	but rather make sure inaccessible elements are usable for lookups, even
	though these elements are invisible to the function scope.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add functions to SafeStack to make 'inaccessible' elements readable. This
	is necessary to implement AVM2 stack behaviour.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't push things to the scope stack ourselves in find_prop_strict; the
	bytecode must take care of that.

2009-06-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-06-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improvement (apparently, at least) to class lookup. Add basic test for

	Change swfmill tests so that it does what you write in the xml instead of
	making things up on its own.

2009-06-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add note about SymbolClassTag.

2009-06-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use swfmill xml2swf instead of swf2xml as the former changes
	character ids from what is specified (may be a bug). Now the
	mixed bytecode as3 test passes; though the pp also worked with
	the incorrect id number.

2009-06-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Log error when parsing SymbolClass tag in AS2 SWF.

2009-06-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop left-over member formely used for the bogus addChild implementation

2009-06-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add an AS3 MovieClip interface. Move the AS functions into 
	flash/display/MovieClip_as.cpp (I'm not sure this is a good idea, as
	MovieClip currently needs access to the interface objects).
	
	Make AVM2 call super constructors somehow (but not necessarily correctly).
	
	Don't return so much on AVM2 failure; break instead.
	
	Drop bogus global addChild functions.

2009-06-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't try creating a MovieClip for now, or it will crash.

2009-06-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Start splitting AS3 and AS2 interface.

2009-06-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-06-15  Bob Naugle  <bobbynaugs@gmail.com>

2009-06-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test some class construction.

2009-06-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make dejagnu class use static functions and vars so that it is less
	complicated.

2009-06-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make things more modular. Introduce a MovieFactory, currently with only

2009-06-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Put Gnash's default tag loaders in their own file, away from impl.cpp.
	
	Make TagLoadersTable non-static, not a singleton, and for now solely owned
	by RunInfo. Load table on startup (temporarily RunInfo construction) as
	there is no advantage to later initialization.
	
	Clean up includes. Rename loader_function to LoaderFunction and expose
	typedefs from TagLoadersTable.

2009-06-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename swf.h and swf.cpp to match Gnash file naming style.

2009-06-12  Jon Crider  <jon.crider@gmail.com>

	Working on array haxe test cases. This is very much complicated by the fact that haxe has it's own implementation of Array which is not necessarily fully compliant with gnash and actionscript. All tests currently compile, but gflashplayer throws errors when running v9 tests. Array_as.hx is not currently included in the Makefile.am and does not build automatically.

	Reasons are obscure to me, but it fixes the disappearence of CPP introduced

2009-06-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move isAS3 logic to fn_call rather than VM, and clean up headers and includes
	as they made this simple change take a long time.

	Add implementation for removeChild and removeChildAt to DisplayList.

2009-06-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement addChild() and addChildAt() in the DisplayList. Currently they

	in fact be members of DisplayObjectContainer only.

2009-06-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement addChild() and addChildAt() using the DisplayList through
	MovieClip (should be DisplayObjectContainer).
	
	Obsolete _childs member in movie_root, as this now delegates to the 
	DisplayList of the _root MovieClip.

	moved to.

2009-06-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Track which version of the VM is executing. It is now possible to initialize
	the correct object prototypes for AS2 and AS3, though not yet to execute
	both AS2 and AS3 in one run.
	
	Test that AS3 classes are not available in AS2, and fix all the new as_objects
	(except filters) to separate them while still allowing selective building
	of classes.
	
	Make classes that exist just for enumerating constants simpler.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test the flash package for the absence of AS3 classes.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tabs to spaces...

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make sure all packages log the AVM version; AVM2-only packages will abort

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Line breaks, tabs to spaces.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	classes where they aren't expected. Assert that certain packages are only
	initialized from the correct kind of bytecode.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename asclasses arrays to as3classes so that we can distinguish between
	them and as2classes.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Load only AVM1 flash package classes when not running AVM2. This needs to
	be done also for the other AVM1 flash package classes (geom, net etc) so
	that extra classes are not loaded.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop empty file. Notify VM when it's executing AVM2 code, as this is the
	only way currently to know whether we are running AS1/2 or AS3. We have
	to know this in order to initialize objects correctly (and for many
	other things).

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Simplify more constant enumeration classes.

2009-05-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add test showing that MovieClip._soundbuftime is a global (like _quality)

2009-05-31  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

2009-05-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add test for enumeration, especially the termination marker.
	
	Make all flash package members enumerable pending better tests.

2009-05-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Enumeration should push an undefined value, not null, as the end marker.
	
	Flash packages should not be hidden from enumeration (but it isn't clear
	exactly what they should be).

2009-05-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Parse scenes and frame labels correctly and add as a control tag as documented.
	Not yet implemented, but gives useful logging information.
	
	Minor cleanups to other tags.

2009-05-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct comment.

2009-05-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add autogenerated macros to .bzrignore.

2009-05-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Parse DefineSceneAndFrameLabelData tag correctly.

2009-05-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	memory corruption.

2009-05-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-05-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Sorry, forgot to cleanup after applying the patch

	Implement partial blitting (inv.bounds based) for SDL/AGG combination

2009-05-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a pointer for the thread, as some versions of boost don't have
	copyable threads.

2009-05-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't use a separate naming style for AVM2 names in VM.
	
	Implement SymbolClassTag fully (but not tested properly).
	
	Check file attributes for whether to use AVM2, and notify when the wrong
	tags are present. Currently we also throw a parsing exception to avoid
	adding code of the wrong type, but whether the file attribute is definitive
	needs more testing. This attribute should also be used for other VM-specific
	code (e.g. TextField constructor) in place of SWF version, which is wrong.

2009-05-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups, add tests.

2009-05-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix some bugs in XMLSocket implementation.

2009-05-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Thread XMLSocket connection so that it doesn't block execution. As expected,
	onConnect is now called in the first advanceState() after the connection
	attempt completes.
	
	Port numbers above 65535 should be rejected immediately.

2009-05-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Const correct Network::connected.
	
	Add intermediate object between Network and XMLSocket_as to allow
	not blocking AS execution during connection (not yet implemented).
	Get the onConnect() order correct (still only correct in limited
	cases).
	
	Restore adding empty strings, as a non-automated test shows is the case.

2009-05-17  rob@welcomehome.org

	fix description of -devel package.

2009-05-17  rob@welcomehome.org

	Add XML prototype as VM static, fixing bug #26390 (segfault in XMLSocket).
	
	Don't send empty strings to XMLSocket.onData.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Include map.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Merge AVM2 machine and parser code from the avm2 branch.
	
	This appears to be stable, but does not work in most cases, so it is disabled
	by default. Compile with --enable-avm2 to enable it.
	
	The default build will now omit AVM2 code, which should reduce code size
	and compile time. There is no warning yet for running AVM2 code without
	AVM2 support.
	
	The perl-generated haxe version of the actionscript.all testsuite is disabled
	as Gnash fails some tests (tests may be bogus).

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanup.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove Namespace.h from Makefile.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove Namespace.h, which was replaced long ago by the asNamespace class.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Define ENABLE_AVM2 properly.
	
	Drop more from the Makefile.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix Makefiles for dropped files.
	
	Drop ctor for TextFieldAutoSize, which only contains static variables.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Merge VM and parsing parts from avm2 branch. Disable all avm2 code by default,
	as it may be unstable.
	
	Most new classes have not been merged because they were only stubs and can be
	generated easily.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct includes in SymbolClassTag.h

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do includes and forward declarations properly to avoid breaking the build
	on the slightest change.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Include gnashconfig.h where needed.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop stubs for AS3 classes, as these can be regenerated easily in
	the newer style.
	
	Fix missing values in ClassHierarchy initialization.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Allow building with AVM2 code.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add copyright to split-off files.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add --enable-avm2 option. Disable the AVM2 interpreter and tag parsers
	unless avm2 is enabled at compile time.
	
	ClassHierarchy (on-demand class loading) uses asNamespace and asClass, so
	these still have to be built even when avm2 is disabled. This requires 
	ifdefs inside asClass.
	
	Split asClass file into separate files for asNamespace, asMethod, asException
	and asBoundValues.

2009-05-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Replace LOG_AVM2 with log_abc.

2009-04-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-04-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More minor cleanups.

2009-04-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-03-31  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Merge from trunk

2009-03-31  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Log aserror and donothing when class to be instantiated isn't found (yeah, I know it'a s gnash bug not finding that, but I think you can reproduce this with a malformed SWF too)

2009-03-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Introduce AVM2 to Gnash coding style. Start some attempt at proper
	encapsulation and replace some of the debugging output hacks.

2009-03-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-04-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Notes on morph shape.

2009-04-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop _drawable_inst. Hold _drawable(DynamicShape) by value instead of
	pointer. This makes MovieClip size still larger, but occupies much less
	memory and reduces fragmentation.
	
	Drop const on return of SWFMatrix::invert, as it is returns non-const *this.
	
	Update some documentation.

2009-04-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Major reorganization of the messy half of Gnash to match the neater half
	and implement the suppposed design consistently. Add a proper DisplayObject
	for MorphShape. The main changes are:
	
	- Rename character_def to DefinitionTag.
	- Rename shape_character_def to DefineShapeTag.
	- Move almost all parsing under the swf directory.
	- Make DefinitionTags really immutable and non-copyable.
	- Only faked definition tag now in MovieClip (though BitmapMovieDefinition
	also comes close).
	- Use the presence of a DefinitionTag to distinguish SWF-defined from
	dynamic DisplayObjects (except in MovieClip).
	- Make DynamicShape and ShapeRecord normal, non-refcounted or GC classes
	for stack allocation and smart-pointer usage.
	- Much more const correctness.
	- More logical design with proper class documentation.
	- Smaller and more consistent renderer interface for shape drawing.
	- GC resources reduced for all glyphs, morph definitions, dynamic shapes,
	BitmapMovies.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix OGL build.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop morph includes again.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make sure all MorphShape's invalidated bounds are returned in getBounds().
	This isn't really what it's for, but was how it worked before.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix cairo build.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move shape_character_def and character_def. Rename to DefineShapeTag
	and DefinitionTag.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Boilerplate and file descriptions.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use ShapeRecord, not DynamicShape for Freetype font walking. This trades
	a bit of code duplication (could be reduced) for a much cleaner interface
	and less memory per glyph.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add documentation for various classes. Const correct definitions and
	member functions. Add libcore/swf to testsuite Makefiles so the testsuite
	builds and runs again. One failure.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop most of shape_character_def interface now it's not used.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Separate DynamicShape completely from shape_character_def.
	
	DynamicShape is not refcounted, so management is always up to the users
	(not yet implemented properly).
	
	DynamicShape is used for Fonts (glyphs), Bitmaps, BitmapMovies and the
	movie_root drawable.
	
	All character_defs should now be immutable and noncopyable.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Start separating DynamicShape and shape_character_def. No display after this commit.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move morph parsing under swf directory.

2009-04-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Const correctness. The morph class no longer needs shape_character_def.
	Fix invalidated bounds of morph for display. Needs testing for AS bounds
	in AVM2.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use ShapeRecord in morph shapes.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add ShapeRecord, a neutral container for shape information.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Construct morph definition directly from SWFStream.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation, minor correction.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Merge from trunk.
	
	Drop advance() code, as it messes up the morph timing in relation to
	MovieClip's advance. MorphShape isn't a LiveChar anymore; morphing is
	done on display() again.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	There are two ways of morphing: either a PlaceObject tag with a move flag,
	or remove and re-add the morph shape with a different ratio. Call morph()
	in the stagePlacementCallback if ratio is not 0 to handle the second
	(less efficient) case.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Re-add pointTestLocal to shape_character_def, as DynamicShape has to override
	it. Remove from base class character_def as it only make sense for shape-like
	characters. It also reveals StaticText had been using the default
	implementation. MorphShape uses geometry::pointTest directly.
	
	Initialize MorphShape members to match shape1 on construction instead of
	the messy way it was done before.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix EdgeTest by using correct class name.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Register MorphShape as a live char so that advance is called.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add Geometry.cpp.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move non-class-specific hit and crossing tests to Geometry.h. Drop
	duplicated functions. Remove class typedef and use the actual name
	everywhere. Indentation.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Restrict renderer interface to drawShape and drawMorph, each taking a 
	definition and a DisplayObject. This is much neater and more consistent.

2009-04-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add MorphShape class. This is mainly for AVM2, but also helps separate
	parsing and execution for AVM1 by storing mutable state information in
	a DisplayObject, not a character definition.

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop Sprite.h, as its information was either wrong or not very useful.

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanup.

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-04-06  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix function calls

2009-04-06  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	loadMovie takes a FILE, not an uri

2009-04-06  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix restart API, after changes to corelib

2009-04-06  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Do something in the boost-required copy ctor: just create a new instance; don't return const std::string& as it seems like boost::python is unable to deal with that

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove unused functions.

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make some Button members private.

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation.

2009-04-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove unused functions from the inheritance chain.

2009-04-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix paranoia build.

2009-04-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop AdvanceableChar typedef as it seems to be a synonym for DisplayObject*;
	various kinds of DisplayObjects - not only MovieClips - need to advance on
	each frame.
	
	Fix paranoia build.

2009-04-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct silly mistake in class naming. Other minor cleanups.

2009-04-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename InteractiveDisplayObject to InteractiveObject, as it should have
	been from the beginning.

2009-04-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop some old code from movie_root, clean up unnecessarily verbose functions.

2009-04-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make can_handle_mouse_event a pure virtual and rename to mouseEnabled().

2009-04-04  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Some updates to make the code closer to build with current libcore.
	Doesn't all really build yet, but gnashpython.o seems to (altought I had to add a weird constructor to make boost::python happy)

2009-04-04  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Minor cleanup to headers inclusion

2009-04-04  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Include boost/cstdint.hpp as those types are used in definition

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Document movie_root::errorInterface(). Tidy up snappingrange a bit.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove extra spaces.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Typo.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tidy up.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Write our own function objects, as it's easier than using bind and mem_fn.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Reduce a bit more with boost::bind and algorithms.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix warning.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Further cleanups.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make certain members mutable for lazy finalization instead of const_casting.
	Add some const correctness.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove some unnecessary members from the DisplayObject base class.
	
	Add class descriptions.
	
	Drop dynClipDepthValue constant as suggested.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Formatting.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop obsoleted comment.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop dynClipDepthValue in favour of using _maskee as suggested in comments.
	This is good because both "reserved" depth values are in fact legal, though
	unlikely depths for createEmptyMovieClip().

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix testsuite build.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop get_movie_definition() from the base class.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor tidying up; add operator!= to cxform for nicer syntax.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update documentation. Remove goto_frame from DisplayObject (only makes sense
	for Sprite or MovieClip). Add virtual dtor to DisplayObject.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update class descriptions.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Reverse the inheritance order of character (now InteractiveDisplayObject)
	and DisplayObject. Now not all DisplayObjects (e.g. StaticText, Shape, Video,
	Bitmap) are also InteractiveDisplayObjects (TextField, MovieClip, Button).
	
	Begin to move appropriate functions from DisplayObject to
	InteractiveDisplayObject. Most of this work is still to be done.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move on_button_event to InteractiveDisplayObject::mouseEvent. Const correct
	movie_root::getTopmostMouseEntity().

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make MouseButtonState members into InteractiveDisplayObjects.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix testsuite build.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename get_topmost_mouse_entity to topmostMouseEntity.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make get_topmost_mouse_entity return an InteractiveDisplayObject, as other
	objects aren't mouse entities.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Override functions as necessary instead of providing getDefinition, as the
	character_def may be 0, making too many potential problems when implementing
	a derived class.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More testsuite fixes.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix more of the testsuite.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add InteractiveDisplayObject code.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Restore more mangled comments.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename functions and variables mangled by sed.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix testsuite.

2009-04-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Reverse inheritance of character and DisplayObject, renaming character to
	InteractiveDisplayObject. The structure is now correct, but DisplayObject
	has many functions that ought to be in InteractiveDisplayObject. These can
	be moved up gradually.
	
	The find-and-replace of character make some odd function and variable
	names (to be fixed).

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Various improvements to const correctness, function signatures and 
	code reuse.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do the same for Mouse object.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make the second argument to the interface call() function optional, as it's
	often not used. Clean up System object.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More const correction.

2009-04-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Const correct.

2009-04-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Flush buffer after each log message on stdout (not for logging to disk). This
	slows down logging again, but is better for debugging.

2009-04-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove extra comma.

2009-04-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-04-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add some minor changes to logging (more logging levels) for use with AVM2.
	Also optimize logging class to improve speed by about 10 percent.

2009-04-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Const correct some as_environment member functions. Use const as_environment
	reference instead of pointer to non-const in various functions.

2009-04-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups.

2009-03-31  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	re-added -{K,k}thread

2009-03-31  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix some missing GC registrations, use std::max's template argument because
	it's more concise.

2009-03-31  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add totals check and 'done' call at end of as3 testcase, add last-line-output check in testrunner and expect it to fail.

2009-03-30  rob@welcomehome.org

	cast boost::int32_t to a real int so std::max is happy when cross compiling.

2009-03-30  rob@welcomehome.org

	when cross-compiling, assume we don't need any flags for pthreads support.

2009-03-30  rob@welcomehome.org

	comment out inet_lnaof(), it's not used.

2009-03-30  rob@welcomehome.org

	Don't create a --enable-* option, as it confuses people, and is never used anyway.

2009-03-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't forget to markAsObjectReachable().

2009-03-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up MovieClipLoader.

2009-03-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move empty dtor inline.

2009-03-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor improvement to LoadableObject.

	Clean up MovieClipLoader.

2009-03-29  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Really fix bug #26036 (fully tested now); include arpa/inet.h for htons

2009-03-29  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Include arpa/inet.h for htons, move system includes after local ones

2009-03-28  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix build with USE_CURL undefined. Fixes bug #26036

2009-03-28  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	InterruptableVirtualClock semantic change: do NOT take ownership of source clock. Makes more sense, as NetStream for instance hooks a time tap to the gnash source clock but doesn't want to destroy that clock afterwards (taps don't take ownerhip of water pumps!)

2009-03-28  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Move the clock source from Player to Gui, have the Gui use an InterruptableVirtualClock controlled by gui pause/play. Have NetStream use the VM clock as source for the PlayBack clock. This commit basically makes the NetStream Playback
	clock controlled by the Gui so that after pause/resume you don't have to
	wait for the whole time elapsed while paused to be consumed before proceeding.
	See the difference going to youtube and doing some pause/resume operations
	using the Gui controls (^p).

2009-03-27  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Cast fill type to int, as the format string suggests being intended

2009-03-27  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Stop mentioning the now obsoleted --enable-mit-shm. Fixes bug #26029.

2009-03-27  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Update info about SWTTABINDEX tag

2009-03-26  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Hide menu bar when in fullscreen. Fixes bug 25959

2009-03-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix movie size on restart. Fix suggested by Michael F?tsch.

2009-03-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Patch as suggested by Michael F?tsch to fix size on restart.

2009-03-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't add separator1 to the file menu twice. Fixes GTK complaint.

2009-03-26  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	fill_style::set_lerp : don't pretend that gradient bitmaps
	are the same for the two shapes of a morph. Dunno if this is correct
	but was the behaviour before I merged bitmap and gradient bitmapInfo
	into one. Fixes assertion failure in bug #25998.

2009-03-26  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Don't close_tag if open_tag wasn't successful.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fill in the as3 testsuite a bit.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make as3compile build conditional.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename hello.as.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make testsuite/as3 build and run.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Modifications to get better test info.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Modify testsuite Makefile for as3.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add a test test.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add check.as.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add Makefile.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improvements.

2009-03-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initial version of dejagnu as3 package with test class enabled.

2009-03-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Continue to parse the next tag after a parsing exception.

2009-03-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Comments.

2009-03-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix awful indentation in sprite_definition, don't stop parsing completely
	when we hit a parsing exception.

2009-03-23  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rearrange function.

2009-03-20  John Wimer  <john@god.vtic.net>

	Add approximate disk and memory requirements for compilation from source

2009-03-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initialize _quality, before doing so again. This is ugly, but at least
	keeps everything happy until someone works out a better way.

2009-03-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor clean ups.

2009-03-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up and remove unused members.

2009-03-19  rob@welcomehome.org

	eliminate most of the compiler warnings, typicaly unused parameters.

2009-03-19  rob@welcomehome.org

	rearrange the order of the libs to keep ubuntu happy.

2009-03-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add boilerplate, correct headers, and gnashconfig.h.

2009-03-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add GnashNumeric.h to libbase/Makefile.am.

2009-03-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Lots of changes resulting from a small rationalization of frequently-used
	headers. GnashNumeric contains mathematical functions. Clean up 
	includes of timer.h (Timer.h) now that it isn't used for object callbacks.
	
	Base GnashException on std::runtime_error, as they should never be
	logic errors.
	
	Remove undefined behaviour that may have been responsible for bugs on
	some ARM platforms. 
	
	Make some preparations for as3compile (swftools) testsuite.

2009-03-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add as3 testsuite dir.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add GnashNumeric.h Remove unused things from URL.cpp, rearrange the file into
	a more conventional order.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test for as3compile.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Bump advertised SWF version to 10.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update testsuite.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct include in render_handler_ogl.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename PIXELS_TO_TWIPS and TWIPS_TO_PIXELS.
	
	Derive GnashException from std::runtime_error.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move mathematical functions to GnashNumeric.h (new header) to separate them
	from typeName, thead identifcation and other miscellanea.
	
	Generalize truncation of double to int so it can be used in SWFMatrix too,
	removing undefined behaviour.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make Timer files purely for the Timer class, move AS methods to Global.cpp
	(they are global methods).
	
	Drop timer.h includes where Timers are no longer needed.

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Make right-click menu 'quit' item consistent with the one under 'File' and add a separator to avoid users from accidentally hit it while trying to toggle sound.

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	add dejagnu clip

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	preformatted info and manual pages regenerated

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Only force a redraw when quality actually changes.
	Still perform the rc query and renderer comunication.

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Test default and overridden quality setting.
	NOTE: the testcase doesn't really test defaults, it should!

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add 'quality' setting example in system-wide installed gnashrc

2009-03-19  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Document 'quality' rc setting

2009-03-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	setQuality() has to be used in movie_root initialization to inform the renderer
	of the initial quality. At this point _quality is either uninitialized or
	set to something sensible; in either case checking the requested quality
	against the set _quality is useless.
	
	Rather than duplicating the entire function without a check, setQuality()
	is now never a no-op. An alternative would be an extra flag that skips the
	check when necessary.

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Initial work on a test for bitmap smoothing (unfinished)

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Print size of movie_root too (not that it matters much)

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Force a redraw when quality changes

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add include for ostream forward declaration

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Base bitmap smoothing heuristic on the new bitmap fill smoothing policy.
	Fixes bug #25894.

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add a bitmap smoothing policy member to fill_style class, taking no additional space (fills some padding space). The policy is based on SWF version and tag type
	(UNSPECIFIED, ON, OFF).

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Reduce size of fill_style from 112 to 80 bytes, w/out changing anything in terms of performance (just drop useless members). 

2009-03-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add size of SWFMatrix

2009-03-17  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Update note about _HARD bitmap fill types

2009-03-17  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add TODO item with documentation about how we should decide when to smoot bitmap fills and when not to. We're currently doing it WRONG (more quality, more CPU load than required)

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix paranoia build again.

2009-03-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix paranoia build again.

2009-03-16  rob@welcomehome.org

	update release number to 0.8.5.

2009-03-16  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Drop obsoleted TODO item (fill styles are not recreated for subshapes anymore)

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Hopefully fix debugger build (untested).

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split long lines in DisplayList, make the class interface cleaner, and
	replace some more loops with standard algorithms.

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rewrite implementation for as object callbacks without using Timers, which 
	reduces overhead and addresses the problem of infinite recursion (callbacks
	added during a callback). It also makes the code much cleaner when
	registering callbacks and removes the need to track them.
	
	Call the callbacks predictably on every heartbeat.
	
	Don't fail instantly when an XML or LoadVars load connection fails; this
	should be delayed until the first callback. Fixes LoadVars tests. The
	onData function requires an undefined, not null, value to signify failure.
	Notify AS callbacks with false, not true, on failure.
	
	NetStream does not need a queue of statuses, but rather only the last
	one set. The fact that Gnash's buffer full event is unpredictable is still
	a small problem, but the behaviour is much more compatible.

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make all LoadVars tests in misc-ming.all pass with a correction to
	onData. Correct XML onData too.

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passing LoadVars tests.

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't maintain a queue of statuses. Only the last one should be necessary.
	This can be tested by calling more than one different NetStream function
	in an onStatus() callback. Only the last one is dealt with on each 
	core heart-beat.

2009-03-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Call processActionQueue whenever advance callbacks have been executed.

2009-03-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Only call onStatus once per advance.

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add a hack to LoadThread so that it can take a failed stream. This is
	necessary for the timing of the onData() and onStatus() calls, which should
	not happen immediately, but at the earliest at the beginning of the next
	frame, if the connection fails. A better solution may be to start the
	connection and download in advanceState().

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct XMLSocket typo, make sure registered objects are kept alive
	until removed from the callbacks list.

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split timers and object callbacks into separate functions.
	
	Allow calling the same status consecutively in NetStream. This almost passes
	the swfdec netstream-load-loop case without endless recursion, only it
	calls onStatus too often.

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a new {add,remove}AdvanceTimer for updating and querying AS objects
	with that need to notify callbacks and update their own status.

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tidy up a bit and remove GnashAlgorithm.h from libmedia's Makefile.am.

2009-03-13  rob@welcomehome.org

	add GnashAlgorithm.h to noinst_HEADERS,

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	New code should really not have tabs in it.

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation and remove useless typedefs.

2009-03-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move generic structs to their own header file so they can be used more
	widely. Add some (respectable) template hackery to make using
	boost::checked_deleter easier on containers of pointers (i.e. without
	specifying the pointed-to type); and because it's done a lot add a
	templated function that deletes all pointers in any standard container
	of pointers.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use checked deleter everywhere.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move more or less generic algorithms into their own file. Extend boost's
	checked_deleter so that we can pass pointers as a template argument, which
	helps with generic programming (or rather with refactoring Gnash).

2009-03-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Return bitmap/gradient matrices by const-ref, not value (worth checking users for possible optimizations)

2009-03-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix --max-advances to refer to SWF frame advances, not hear-beats

2009-03-13  rob@welcomehome.org

	add LIBADD_DL to get build slave to finish.

2009-03-13  rob@welcomehome.org

	make test xcheck for now.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remaining cleanup of defines in FLVParser.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused defines.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pad buffer correctly in FLV parser, fixing illegal reads and uninitialized
	values in parsing some FLVs. It's still not at all exception-safe, but much
	tidier.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pad input data properly (i.e. up to the end of the buffer) and set frame size
	to the number of bytes actually read. Before, the frame size was set to the
	number of bytes requested, regardless of how much was read, and only 64 bytes
	(the padding) were set to 0, leaving the end of the buffer uninitialized
	while inviting the media handler to read it.
	
	Eight bytes of padding should now be sufficient.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Attempt to render RGBA video, fix illegal read on probe of h264 (and
	potentially other formats), remove unnecessary memcopy in VideoDecoderFfmpeg.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make sure the probe buffer is padded and zeroed out, as the ffmpeg probe
	reads past the number of bytes it's told about.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add ctor from pre-existing data for ImageRGBA (for consistency with ImageRGB).
	Allow ffmpeg to write video frames directly to new image data instead of
	copying each frame.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	As a VideoRenderer is constructed for each frame, drop the mutator
	functions for smoothing and quality and pass them in the ctor.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	At least attempt to render RGBA video, even if the alpha data aren't
	there.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove gratuitously rude comment about exceptions.

2009-03-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't use a widget as a callback. Fixes segfaults when using menus.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop unused functions, clean up and some minor renaming.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More function name shortening.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove unnecessary variables from the class definition. Drop declarations of
	non-existent functions.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Algorithmize code for efficiency and ease of reading.
	
	Rename functions for clarity and to make them more likely to fit on
	one line.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Renaming and refactoring.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix unused variable warning.

2009-03-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Formatting and code cleanup in morph2_character_def.

2009-03-12  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix fps debugging to actually return rate of SWF advancement, not heart-beating one. It helps evaluating/profiling effects of heart-beating rates on SWF playback. For example, try using -d to set a delay which matches SWF nominal frame rate and actual rendering FPS improves (reducing no-op heartbeats).

2009-03-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement TextSnapshot better; all tests of implemented methods pass. 
	Selections are now queried directly from the StaticText characters.
	
	Derive two new classes from  generic_character (now DisplayObject) into
	Shape and StaticText so that they can more easily be used differently
	(for TextSnapshot). The inheritance of DisplayObject from character
	(should be: InteractiveObject) is still the wrong way round.
	
	Rename shape.h to Geometry.h to avoid any conflicts with Shape.h.

2009-03-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Document StaticText.
	
	Drop unnecessary functor operator.
	
	Reduce debugging.

2009-03-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passing selection tests in TextSnapshotTest.

2009-03-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up and document more.

2009-03-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Ugly version of working TextSnapshot (selection).

2009-03-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tidy up getStaticText so that it only returns StaticTexts, which disrupts the
	inheritance chain less.
	
	Clean up inheritance in the new classes: keep pointers to polymorphic
	classes as ungeneric as possible.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Begin rearranging inheritance to reflect AS3 classes better; this makes
	handling StaticText objects easier for TextSnapshot, and also prepares
	for implementing AS3.
	
	generic_character becomes DisplayObject, from which Shape and StaticText
	inherit directly.
	
	character should derive from DisplayObject as InteractiveDisplayObject,
	not be its base class, but this is not yet implemented.
	
	All character_defs now require a createDisplayObject() method. This
	unfortunately includes BitmapMovieDefinition and SWFMovieDefinition, but
	that reflects the existing bad design.

2009-03-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix unused variable warning

2009-03-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Quote actual movie url in launcher

2009-03-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Oops, forgot to close an open paren

2009-03-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Don't use PIX_FMT_NV12/21 when not supported by the ffmpeg version building against (fixed build on debian 4.0)

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement and test TextSnapshot more.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add more tests showing that the selection is in fact stored in the TextFields,
	not the TextSnapshot, and reset on construction of a snapshot.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename Font functions and clean up code formatting.
	
	Correct matrix members of getTextRunInfo() objects.
	
	Add more tests.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add more getTextRunInfo() items.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename Font::get_name() to Font::name(). Add toRGBA() to rgba class.
	
	TextRecords with no color field also have zero, not full alpha (tested only in
	TextSnapshotTest.c, so there may be exceptions).
	
	Implement some of getTextRunInfo().

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Stub getTextRunInfo() function.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test getTextRunInfo.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Log language code number.

2009-03-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Log once.

2009-03-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Test resolution of querystring and anchors in relative urls, and fix it (was broken)

2009-03-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix port resolution of relative urls

2009-03-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	'std::vector' has not been declared ...

2009-03-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Refine TextSnapshot implementation. Implement more methods. Fixes new and
	old tests.

2009-03-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct getSelectedText() return.

2009-03-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement getSelectedText(). Almost all tests pass.

2009-03-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Only decode the required part of the text for efficiency. This also makes
	it easier to get the length correct with and without line breaks. Use a
	function instead of a functor and algorithms, as it is better for breaking
	early.

2009-03-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename class.

	Silence debugging.

	Store TextRecords instead of strings in TextSnapshot so that all the necessary
	information is available. Decode on demand instead of storing the text
	as a string alongside the TextRecords. This is much more expensive than storing
	the string; which option is more appropriate in the end depends on the use
	case, which in turn depends on pp performance. Presently there is no
	information on this.
	
	Move most TextSnapshot-related processing into the TextSnapshot_as class /
	implementation.

  <title>The Debug Logging System</title>

  <para>
    Gnash supports a debug logging system which supports both C and C++
    natively. This means you can use both <emphasis>printf()</emphasis> style
    debug messages and C++ <emphasis>iostreams</emphasis> style, where you can
    print C++ objects directly as you would when using
    <emphasis>cout</emphasis>.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    In the beginning, Gnash only supported the C API for debug
    logging, so it is the most heavily used in Gnash. This API was used in
    the <emphasis>log_msg()</emphasis> and <emphasis>log_error()</emphasis> functions,
    and used a callback to set them up.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    It became apparent one day the callback was never needed, and I
    got tired of having to use <emphasis>c_str()</emphasis> on string data
    just to print them out.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    If a filename is not specified at object construction time, a
    default name of <emphasis>gnash-dbg.log</emphasis> is used. If Gnash is
    started from the command line, the debug log will be created in
    the current directory. When executing Gnash from a launcher under
    <emphasis>GNOME</emphasis> or <emphasis>KDE</emphasis> the debug file goes in your
    home directory, since that's considered the current directory.
  </para>

  <para>
    There is common functionality between using the C or C++
    API. Optional output is based on flags that can be set or
    unset. Multiple levels of verbosity are supported, so you can get
    more output by supplying multiple <emphasis>-v</emphasis> options on the
    command line. You can also disable the creation of the debug log.
  </para>

      These functions are clones of the originals as they were used
      for Gnash. These function the same as always except output can
      be logged to disk now as well. These currently print no
      timestamp with the output, which is the older functionality. As
      these functions are implemented on top of the C++ API now, they
      can be used without corrupting the output buffers.

      This is the new C++ streams based API that can be used to print

    <para>
      There are two macros used for program tracing. these can be used
      in both C or C++ code with one little difference. Since C
      doesn't have destructors, you must call
      <emphasis>GNASH_REPORT_RETURN</emphasis> at the end of a function to
      display the function returning message.

	    When this is included in a C++ method, a message is
	    printed when entering and exiting this method by hooking
	    into the constructor and destructor. These are always
	    written to the disk file, but optionally written to the
	    screen only at the highest levels of verbosity.

      This is the main API for the logging system. By default
      everything is setup to write to the default
      <emphasis>gnash-dbg.log</emphasis> file whenever a verbose option is
      supplied. Optionally it is possible to open a log file with a
      specified name, allowing multiple output files.

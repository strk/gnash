The original slide presentation as created by Helen Cook and Ann Barcomb.
Rights to the slides and the filmed speech were given to the Perl
Foundation, which offers the material under GPL2 or the Artistic
License (user's choice).  The movie was exported from Keynote into
this format by a third party.

All images except for the closing image where taken at the conference 
for use in this presentation.

Contributed by Ann Barcomb.

== Description ==

This movie was created as a lightning talk for YAPC::NA 2006.  It depicts 
several key members of the Perl community as criminals who were sentenced 
to spend time in the SSV dorm rooms (the conference accomodation), which 
resembled a prison.

As it was designed as a slide presentation, the movie consists of still 
images with text and a few appearance effects.
